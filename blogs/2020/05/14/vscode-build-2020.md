# Visual Studio Code at Build 2020

May 14, 2020 by Alessandro Segala, [@ItalyPaleAle](https://twitter.com/ItalyPaleAle)

The [Microsoft Build 2020](https://mybuild.microsoft.com) conference is starting next Tuesday, May 19, and will be running for 48 continuous hours. For the first time, Build is a fully digital event, open to everyone for free.

Our team has been hard at work creating new experiences for all developers using Visual Studio Code. At Build, we'll demo new features we've been working on in VS Code (hint: Preferences Sync!) as well as Notebooks, Remote Development, and a bunch of cool tips and tricks. You will also be able to check out what we've been working on with partner teams (Visual Studio Codespaces, Visual Studio Live Share) and together with our friends at GitHub.

In our sessions, you can learn how Visual Studio Code enables teams to remain productive and collaborate even when distributed.

## Connect with live sessions

There are a number of great live sessions at Build, too many list here, but we think the following offerings will be interesting to developers using Visual Studio Code. All of these sessions are going to be live-streamed on the [Microsoft Build](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/) website, and are repeated three times across three time zones. And, each session includes a live Q&A at the end.

All times shown below are in Pacific Time; click on the time to see it converted to your local time zone.

## Follow us for more

The sessions above just scratch the surface of what our team (and our teammates at Microsoft and GitHub) have been working on and will showcase at Build. Check out the [Microsoft Build](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/) website for the complete agenda, including keynotes, all other developer sessions, and more opportunities to engage with us.

We hope to connect with you (virtually) at Build, and look forward to you joining us! See you next week.

Happy Coding!
