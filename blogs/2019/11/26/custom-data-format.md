# Custom Data Format: Evolving HTML and CSS Language Features

November 26, 2019 by Pine Wu, [@octref](https://github.com/octref)

The web evolves, so does its languages. New entities continuously land in HTML and CSS specifications; HTML Custom Elements add Houdini allows custom HTML tags and CSS properties defined through JavaScript; many developers today develop on the web with frameworks built on top of HTML and CSS syntax. Although HTML and CSS see increasingly flexible usage, editor support for them lags behind.

To modernize the HTML and CSS language support in Visual Studio Code, we designed the [Custom Data Format](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-custom-data), a declarative JSON format for describing HTML and CSS entities. VS Code's HTML and CSS language servers can read data defined in this format and adapt its language support to handle the provided HTML and CSS entities.

In this blog post, we illustrate usage of Custom Data Format and explain how you can take advantage of it.

## Decoupling semantic data from language service

## More data, more features

## Web Components

## Programmatic usage

Happy Coding!
