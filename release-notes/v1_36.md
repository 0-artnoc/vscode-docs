## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.36 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75103)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/95?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Hide individual status bar entries

We added a context menu to the status bar that allows to hide and show individual entries.

The configuration is persisted globally across all workspaces.

## Extension authoring

### Node.js update

The version of Electron that VS Code runs on has been updated which brings with it an update to Node.js from `10.2.0` to `10.11.0`. All extensions will now run on this newer version of Node.js.

## Engineering

### Electron 4.0 update and Electron 6.0 exploration

In this milestone, we finished the exploration of bundling Electron 4 into VS Code, making it the first time we ship this Electron version with stable. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 69 and Node.js 10.11.0 (a major leap forward compared to our current version that has Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.2.0).

At the same time, we started to explore updating to Electron 6, which we hope to push to Insiders soon.

### Linux 32-bit support ends

VS Code is using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) as framework to run on multiple platforms. With this release we move to Electron 4.x, which means that VS Code will no longer run on Linux 32-bit. Please [update](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) your version of VS Code to the 64-bit version. All your settings and extensions will work as before without the need to migrate anything. You can read the [related blog post](https://electronjs.org/blog/linux-32bit-support) from Electron for more information.
