## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.36 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75103)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/95?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Hide individual status bar entries

There is now a context menu for the status bar to hide and show individual entries.

The configuration is persisted globally across all workspaces.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.5.2

### Installer for Java developers

There is a new [Java installer](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-win) for Visual Studio Code to help developers set up their Java environment, which is especially useful for students and those new to the Java programming language. Once launched, the installer automatically detects whether the JDK (Java Development Kit), Visual Studio Code, and required extensions are already installed. If not, the installer can download and configure the missing dependencies for you. You can also use the installer to add the Java related components to your existing Visual Studio Code installation.

With the Java extensions installed, Visual Studio Code provides comprehensive Java development features such as smart code completion, refactoring, debugging, and testing as well as project management and application server integration.

## Extension authoring

### Node.js update

The Electron version that VS Code runs on has been updated and brings with it an update to Node.js from `10.2.0` to `10.11.0`. All extensions will now run on this newer version of Node.js.

### DocumentLink.tooltip

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

## Engineering

### Electron 4.0 update and Electron 6.0 exploration

In this milestone, we finished the exploration of bundling Electron 4 into VS Code, making it the first time this Electron version ships with stable. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 69 and Node.js 10.11.0 (a major leap forward from our current version with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.2.0).

We have started to explore updating to Electron 6, which we hope to push to Insiders soon.

### Better code loading

// todo@joh

### Linux 32-bit support ends

VS Code is using the [Electron framework](https://electronjs.org/) to run on multiple platforms. With this release, we move to Electron version 4.x, which means that VS Code will no longer run on Linux 32-bit. Please [update](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to a 64-bit version of VS Code. All your settings and extensions will work as before, without the need to migrate anything. You can read the related [blog post from Electron](https://electronjs.org/blog/linux-32bit-support) for more information.
