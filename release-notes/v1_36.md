## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.36 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75103)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/95?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Hide individual status bar entries

There is now a context menu for the status bar to hide and show individual entries.

The configuration is persisted globally across all workspaces.

## Tasks

### Sequential dependency execution

The `"dependsOn"` task attribute still defaults to running all dependencies in parallel, but now you can specify `"dependsOrder": "sequence"` and have your task dependencies executed in the order they are listed in `"dependsOn"`. Any background/watch tasks used in `"dependsOn"` must have a problem matcher that tracks when they are “done”. The following task runs task Two, task Three, and then task One.

```
{
    "label": "One",
	"type": "shell",
	"command": "echo Hello ",
	"dependsOrder": "sequence",
	"dependsOn":[
		"Two",
		"Three"
	]
}
```

### Problem matcher path detection

When task output is scanned for problems, information about the path is provided using the `"fileLocation"` problem matcher attribute. In addition to the existing `"relative"` and `"absolute"` options, you can now specify `"autoDetect"`. Using `"autoDetect"` will cause the task system to guess whether the paths in the problems are relative or absolute.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.5.2

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### TypeScript useSeparateSyntaxServer

### Installer for Java developers

There is a new [Java installer](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-win) for Visual Studio Code to help developers set up their Java environment, which is especially useful for students and those new to the Java programming language. Once launched, the installer automatically detects whether the JDK (Java Development Kit), Visual Studio Code, and required extensions are already installed. If not, the installer can download and configure the missing dependencies for you. You can also use the installer to add the Java related components to your existing Visual Studio Code installation.

![java-installer](images/1_36/java-installer.png)

With the Java extensions installed, Visual Studio Code provides comprehensive Java development features such as smart code completion, refactoring, debugging, and testing as well as project management and application server integration.

## Extension authoring

### Splitting `vscode` package into `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`

During the [event-stream incident](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/11/26/event-stream) last year, we found that the `vscode` package was affected as its 223 transitive dependencies included `event-stream`. These dependencies also cause GitHub security alerts from time to time for many VS Code extensions. To address the dependency bloat, we started slimming down `vscode`.

The `vscode` package had served two purposes:

* Pull down `vscode.d.ts` for extension development.
* Run integration tests by downloading and launching a local copy of VS Code.

Now we are splitting `vscode` into `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`, two packages with more focused functionality.

* [`@types/vscode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/vscode) contains `vscode.d.ts` for each release. For example, `npm i @types/vscode@1.34.0` installs the VS Code 1.34 Extension API. Unlike `vscode` which pulls down `vscode.d.ts` through a `postinstall` script, this package can be fully cached by package managers.
* [`vscode-test`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-test) provides a set of APIs to run integration tests with VS Code. The old `vscode` package will continue to work, but new features would go to `vscode-test`. We suggest that you switch over to `vscode-test`, which features a slimmer dependency graph and a more flexible, explicitly documented API. You can learn more about using `vscode-test` in the [Testing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension) article.

Additionally:

* [`vscode-dts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) allows you to quickly download any version of the VS Code API via CLI.
* [`vsce`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-vsce) now checks `@types/vscode` version against `engines.vscode` to prevent you from using a new API incompatible with older versions of VS Code.
* The [`helloworld-test-sample`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/helloworld-test-sample), [Testing Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension) page, and [Continuous Integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/continuous-integration) page are updated to use `vscode-test`.
* [Testing Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension) page contains a [migration guide]() to help you transition from `vscode` to `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`.
* All [sample extensions](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples) are updated to use `@types/vscode`.
* [VS Code Extension Generator](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-generator-code) now scaffolds extensions using the `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test` packages.

### Node.js update

The Electron version that VS Code runs on has been updated and brings with it an update to Node.js from `10.2.0` to `10.11.0`. All extensions will now run on this newer version of Node.js.

### More properties marked as readonly or ReadonlyArray in `vscode.d.ts`

We've marked a few more properties in the VS Code API as readonly to better express our with extensions. Notable changes include:

* All fields on event interfaces are now readonly. Event objects should never be mutated as the same object can be dispatched to multiple listeners.
* The methods on `DiagnosticCollection` now take readonly arrays. This change was made because you can only update a `DiagnosticCollection` through its methods, not by mutating an array previously passed to it.
* `Extensions.all` is now a readonly array since it cannot be mutated.
* `TextEditor.insertSnippet` now takes readonly arrays since it does not mutate its parameters.

These new `readonly` modifiers may cause compile errors for extension code that explicitly typed out the non-readonly types that the VS Code API was previously using:

```ts
vscode.window.onDidChangeTextEditorSelection(e => {
    // Error: `e.selections` is now a readonly array but
    // our `updateForSelections` function takes a mutatable array
    updateForSelections(e.selections);
});

function updateForSelections(selections: vscode.Selection[]) {
    ...
}
```

To fix this, just propogate the `readonly` modifier through your extension's code as well:

```ts
vscode.window.onDidChangeTextEditorSelection(e => {
    updateForSelections(e.selections);
});

function updateForSelections(selections: readonly vscode.Selection[]) {
    ...
}
```


## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### vscode.workspace.fs

There is proposed API to allow extensions to interact with [file system providers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/b1dd5ab40e08315fcc8f58310556479738a5e7b2/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L5642). That allows to create, read, write, and delete files and folders from arbitrary file systems, e.g a language extension can now load source files that are provided from an ftp-server or another remote source.

The API can be accessed via a new property on the workspace-object: `vscode.workspace.fs`. Give it a try and feel free to leave feedback on: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/48034

### Updated API for code insets

We have refactored and simplified the code insets proposal. Instead of using the provider-pattern it it is now more like text decorations API.

```ts
export function createWebviewTextEditorInset(editor: TextEditor, line: number, height: number, options?: WebviewOptions): WebviewEditorInset;
```

Given an editor, a line, and a height you can create insets. Insets then use the [`Webview`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/b1dd5ab40e08315fcc8f58310556479738a5e7b2/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L5817) that's already known from the `WebviewPanel`. As with decorations, insets are being disposed once their containing editor closes.

### Webview.resourceRoot

## Engineering

### Electron 4.0 update and Electron 6.0 exploration

In this milestone, we finished the exploration of bundling Electron 4 into VS Code, making it the first time this Electron version ships with stable. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 69 and Node.js 10.11.0 (a major leap forward from our current version with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.2.0).

We have started to explore updating to Electron 6, which we hope to push to Insiders soon.

### Better code loading

Electron 4 gave us access to new script caching APIs. With that [cached data](https://v8.dev/blog/code-caching) can be created without affecting the very first start and it can be created repeatedly to also cover lazily parsed functions. That and improvements in our loader resulted in ~15% faster code loading.

### Linux 32-bit support ends

VS Code is using the [Electron framework](https://electronjs.org/) to run on multiple platforms. With this release, we move to Electron version 4.x, which means that VS Code will no longer run on Linux 32-bit. Please [update](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to a 64-bit version of VS Code. All your settings and extensions will work as before, without the need to migrate anything. You can read the related [blog post from Electron](https://electronjs.org/blog/linux-32bit-support) for more information.
