Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.42 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87479)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Configurable limit of maximum opened editors

New settings have been added to limit the maximum number of editors that are open at the same time. Specifically:
* `workbench.editor.limit.enabled`: to enable this feature (off by default)
* `workbench.editor.limit.perEditorGroup`: to apply this limit per editor group or across all groups
* `workbench.editor.limit.value`: the actual limit of editors (10 by default)

Once enabled, VSCode will start to close the least recently used editor once you open a new editor.

**Note:** dirty editors are never automatically closed but they still count into the overall number of opened editors.

### Untitled editor improvements

Untitled editors in VSCode are text buffers that are not yet saved to disk. You can leave them open for as long as you like and all text content is stored and restored between restarts.

So far, untitled editors would have a very generic name such as *Untitled-1* and counting onwards. In this release, untitled editors will take the content of the first line of the document for the editor title:

*Theme: [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme)*

**Note:** if the first line is empty or does not contain any words, the title will show as before.

By default, untitled files will not have a specific language mode configured. We always had a setting `files.defaultLanguage` to configure a default language for untitled files. A new value `{activeEditorLanguage}` was added to dynamically use the language mode of the currently active editor instead of a fixed one.

To make life easier when you copy and paste text into an untitled editor, we now automatically change the language mode of the untitled editor if the text was copied from a VSCode editor:

![Untitled Label](images/1_42/untitled-copy.gif)

*Theme: [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme)*

**Note:** if the untitled editor already has a language mode specified, pasting text will not change it.

### Changed default settings to restore all windows on restart

VSCode's setting for restoring windows on startup has changed to restore all windows by default. If you want to get back previous behaviour, configure `"window.restoreWindows": "one"`.

### Ignore save conflicts

VSCode has a built in mechanism that will show an error when you try to save a dirty file that has been changed outside of VSCode or by another program (including e.g. git):

![Save Conflict](images/1_42/save-conflict.png)

The motivation is to inform you that saving will overwrite the contents on disk even though they changed after the file became dirty. Clicking the "Compare" button lets you review your change with the version on disk and either overwrite or revert the file.

To make life easier in cases where you know that the changes on disk can be overwritten, there is now a new "Overwrite" button directly from the notification. On top of that you can configure `files.preventSaveConflicts` globally or per workspace or file type to disable the notification altogether.

## VSCode Web

### Drag and drop files into the editor area to open them

The web version of VSCode now allows you to drop local files into the editor area to open them as dirty files with the contents of the files.
