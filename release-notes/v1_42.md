# January 2020 (version 1.42)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.42 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87479)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Limit the number of open editors

There are new settings to limit the maximum number of editors that are open at the one time.

* `workbench.editor.limit.enabled`: Enable this feature (off by default).
* `workbench.editor.limit.perEditorGroup`: Whether to apply the limit per editor group or across all groups.
* `workbench.editor.limit.value`: The maximum number of open editors (10 by default).

If enabled, VS Code will close the least recently used editor when you open a new editor. Below you can see the behavior when the limit is set to 3:

![Open editor limit](images/1_42/editor-limit.gif)

*Theme: [Nord](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code)*

**Note:** Dirty editors (files with unsaved changes) are never automatically closed but still count in the total number of open editors.

### Untitled editor improvements

Untitled editors in VS Code are text buffers that have not yet been saved to disk. You can leave them open for as long as you like and all text content is stored and restored between restarts.

Untitled editors were given generic names such as `Untitled-1` and counting upwards. In this release, untitled editors will use the content of the first line of the document for the editor title and include the generic name as the description:

![Untitled file title using first line of text](images/1_42/untitled-title2.gif)

*Theme: [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme)*

**Note:** If the first line is empty or does not contain any words, the title will fall back to `Untitled-*` as before.

By default, untitled files do not have a specific language mode configured. VS Code has a setting, `files.defaultLanguage`, to configure a default language for untitled files. With this release, the setting can take a new value `{activeEditorLanguage}` that will dynamically use the language mode of the currently active editor instead of a fixed default.

In addition, when you copy and paste text into an untitled editor, VS Code will now automatically change the language mode of the untitled editor if the text was copied from a VS Code editor:

![Untitled file language mode dynamically set](images/1_42/untitled-copy2.gif)

*Theme: [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme)*

**Note:** If the untitled editor already has a language mode specified, pasting text will not change it.

### Navigate most recently used editors

With this release, there is now a list of most recently used editors across all editor groups. An editor is considered recently used when it either opens as the active editor or becomes the new active editor if already opened. Once an editor is closed, it is removed from this list.

One application of this list is the new `edt mru` picker that you can open through the new **View: Show All Editors By Most Recently Used** (`workbench.action.showAllEditorsByMostRecentlyUsed`) command:

![MRU editor list](images/1_42/editor-mru.png)

You can add keyboard shortcuts to quickly navigate in this picker without using the mouse. For example, below is a keybinding to so that `kbstyle(Ctrl+Tab)` and `kbstyle(Ctrl+Shift+Tab)` navigates across editors of all groups (instead of only within the active group as the default keybindings do):

```json
{
		"key": "ctrl+tab",
		"command": "workbench.action.quickOpenPreviousRecentlyUsedEditor",
		"when": "!inEditorsPicker"
},
{
		"key": "ctrl+shift+tab",
		"command": "workbench.action.quickOpenLeastRecentlyUsedEditor",
		"when": "!inEditorsPicker"
}
```

If you want to navigate the list without using a picker, there are new commands:

* **View: Open Next Recently Used Editor** (`workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditor`)
* **View: Open Previous Recently Used Editor** (`workbench.action.openPreviousRecentlyUsedEditor`)

To differentiate which editor navigation commands work with a picker and which ones don't, the behavior of some existing commands has changed. Specifically, the **Recently Used Editor in Group** commands no longer use a picker:

* **View: Open Next Recently Used Editor in Group** (`workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`)
* **View: Open Previous Recently Used Editor in Group** (`workbench.action.openPreviousRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`)

Use **View: Quick Open Previous Recently Used Editor in Group** (`workbench.action.quickOpenPreviousRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`) and **View: Quick Open Least Recently Used Editor in Group** (`workbench.action.quickOpenLeastRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`) for picker-based navigation.

### Changed default settings to restore all windows on restart

VS Code's setting for restoring windows on startup has changed to restore all windows by default. If you want to go back to the previous behavior, configure `"window.restoreWindows": "one"`.

### Ignore save conflicts

VS Code has a built-in mechanism to show an error when you try to save a dirty file that has been changed outside of VS Code or by another program (for example Git):

![Save Conflict](images/1_42/save-conflict.png)

The motivation is to inform you that saving will overwrite the contents on disk even though the file was changed after the file became dirty. Clicking the **Compare** button lets you review your change along with the version on disk and either overwrite or revert the file.

In cases where you know that the changes on disk can be overwritten, there is now an **Overwrite** button directly on the notification. You can also configure `files.saveConflictResolution` globally or per workspace or file type to disable this behavior altogether.

### Better handling of slow save operations

VS Code allows extensions to change a file's contents when saving files to disk. Features like **Format on Save** and **Fix on Save** are examples. However, saving is a critical operation and extensions doing processing during a save must finish quickly so that the actual save operation can proceed. "Quickly" used to be enforced by VS Code with timeouts that would make VS Code cancel extension save participation. That enforcement guaranteed speedy saving but could be frustrating because sometimes expected processing would not happen. With this release, we have given up the timeout-based approach and instead show a progress notification that allows you to cancel extensions participating in save ("Save Participants"). The notification lets you know that save operations are running and you can decide if you want to wait for a save participant to finish or not.

![Save Participant notification](images/1_42/save-participant.png)

*Theme: Light+*

### Rename Preview

VS Code now allows you to preview **Rename** changes. When renaming, you can confirm a new name via `kb('acceptRenameInputWithPreview')` and the **Refactor Preview** panel shows. It displays pending changes in a diff editor and allows you to uncheck/check individual changes. Once the rename has been applied (or aborted), the diff editor and preview panel close, putting you back in the current editor.

![Rename Preview](images/1_42/preview-rename-java.png)

*Theme: GitHub Sharp Dark, Font: FiraCode*

### SCM Editor

The input box in the Source Control view now uses the Monaco Editor. This brings in useful functionality such as multiple cursors and move/copy line commands.

### Accessibility improvements

#### Suggest widget improvements

Now the suggest widget no longer uses aria alerts and properly indicates to the screen reader that it is focused. Thus it should no longer happen that the screen readers gets in the way and that the screen reader is unaware of this.

#### editor.accessibilityPageSize set to 160 when screen reader detected

`editor.accessibilityPageSize` is a setting that controls the number of lines in the editor that can be read out by a screen reader at once. However this has a performance implication for large value. We have decided to automatically set this setting to 160 when we detect a screen reader (and not to more due to an NVDA bug).

#### Linux accessibility with Orca

We have started looking into making VS Code accessible on Linux with Orca screen reader. However since this work requires Electron 7 we expect to have more progress in the next stable release. In the meantime for Linux accessibility you can use our insiders version and provide feedback.

## Editor

### Control Peek focus

There is a new setting and command to control where the Peek view initially places focus. By default, Peek focuses the tree on the right-hand side so that you can quickly navigate to references. Initial focus on the tree is not best for people wanting to use Peek for making quick code changes in the editor. You can now define your preference with the `editor.peekWidgetDefaultFocus` setting, which can be set to `editor` or `tree`. There is also a new command `togglePeekWidgetFocus` (`kb('togglePeekWidgetFocus')`) that allows you to move focus between the Peek editor and tree.

## Integrated Terminal

### Scrolling sensitivity

The terminal's scrolling sensitivity can now be configured independent of the editor using the new settings `terminal.integrated.mouseWheelScrollSensitivity` and `terminal.integrated.fastScrollSensitivity`.

## Debugger

### Debug start view simplified

To further simplify the _debug start view_ we now only show one "Run and Debug" button.
The "Run Without Debugging" action (which is not supported by all debuggers), is still available under the "Debug" main menu.

Based on user feedback we now show the breakpoints view in the start view if you have at least one breakpoint set.

![debug start](images/1_42/debug-start.png)

### Debug Console Improvements

#### Debug console input mode

The debug console input now uses the language mode of the current active editor. Due to this debug console input now has coloring, indentation, auto closing of quotes and other language features.

![debug console mode](images/1_42/debug-console-mode.png)

#### Input output presentation
We have tuned how we present input and output in the debug console to make it more distinguishable. Now we render an arrow only next to the input expression.

![debug start](images/1_42/debug-input-output.png)

#### Setting to hide Debug Console after debugging

A new setting `debug.console.closeOnEnd` has been introduced that controls whether the debug console should automatically close after debugging has stopped.

#### Support for `console.table(...)`

We now properly render debug console output coming from Node's `console.table(...)` API.

![debug console table](images/1_42/debug-console-table.png)


#### Debug console input history suggestions

In the debug console's input box we now automatically suggest entries entered previously. The text icon is used to distinguish these entries from the rest.

![debug console history](images/1_42/debug-console-history.png)

### Loaded Scripts View improvements

The Loaded Scripts View has been updated to use VS Code's new tree view. With this it now renders single child folders in the same compact form as VS Code's file explorer. In addition it is now possible to search and expand the tree as you type.

### Launch configuration sorting and grouping

Launch configurations and compounds now support the field `presentation`. Using the `presentation` field you can sort, group and hide configurations and compounds in the debug configuration dropdown and in the debug quick pick.

For example a launch configuration can have the following `presentation` field:
```json
"presentation": {
		"group": "5_tests",
		"order": 10,
		"hidden": false
}
```
As an example in the VS Code repository now the configurations are more easier to use.

![debug dropdown](images/1_42/debug-dropdown.png)

### Debug activity bar decoration
When debugging we now show a number decoration in the debug activity bar. This number represents the count of active debug sessions.

![debug activity](images/1_42/debug-activity.png)


## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

## Contributions to extensions

### Java debugger supports Data Breakpoints

The [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug) extension  now supports [Data Breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38#_debugging), introduced in 1.38. This feature allows you to create breakpoints that will get hit when the value of the underlying variable changes.

Below you can see the debugger breaks when the `Owner.telephone` string changes:

![Data Breakpoints Java](images/1_42/data-breakpoints.png)

### Java Call Hierarchy view

The [Language Support for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) extension now supports a [Call Hierarchy](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_40#_extension-authoring) view, which shows all calls from or to a function and allows you to drill into callers of callers and call of calls.

Right-click on a symbol and select **Peek -> Peek Call Hierarchy** to see the call hierarchy:

![Call Hierarchy Java](images/1_42/call-hierarchy.png)

## Extension authoring

### Codicons for reuse

For most VS Code icons, the [codicon](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/dist/codicon.html) icon-font is used. Extensions can now reuse those icons in simple and declarative ways:

* The `vscode.ThemeIcon` type can now be instantiated with the name of a codicon. For example, `new vscode.ThemeIcon("zap")`.
* The `vscode.MarkdownString` type now supports the `$(<name>)` inline syntax. For example, `myMdString.appendMarkdown('Hello $(globe)');`. Note that use of codicons within `MarkdownString` is enabled with the `supportThemeIcons` constructor argument.
* `commands` defined in an extension's [`package.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.commands) file can now use a codicon for their icon. Use the inline syntax, for example `"icon": "$(zap)"`.

![codicon hover](images/1_42/codicon-api-md.png)

*Theme: Light+*

The hover example above is rendering every available codicon. The hover was created with the snippet below but for readability, most of the codicon names were removed from the `all` constant.

```ts
vscode.languages.registerHoverProvider('*', new class implements vscode.HoverProvider {
	provideHover(doc: vscode.TextDocument, pos: vscode.Position) {
		const all = `$(activate-breakpoints)$(add)...$(zoom-out)`;
		const md = new vscode.MarkdownString(all, true);
		return new vscode.Hover(md, doc.getWordRangeAtPosition(pos));
	}
});
```

### Insert and replace for completion items

Completions that are triggered at the end of a word usually replace that word. However when completions are triggered inside words, it's not clear if the word-end should be replaced or not. Depending on the preference of the extension author, users get the one behavior or the other. That's not ideal and now there is an API to express the insert and replace ranges for a completion item.

For that, we have added a new OR-type to `CompletionItem#range`:

```ts
export class CompletionItem {

	range?: Range | { inserting: Range; replacing: Range; };

	//...
}
```

1. If the range is `undefined`, then VS Code uses the current word range for **replacing** and the same range cropped at the cursor position for **inserting**.
2. If the range is a simple `vscode.Range`, then VS Code knows there is only one location for inserting or replacing.
3. If the range is an object with `inserting` and `replacing` ranges, VS Code will use them as-is.

This information is used in combination with `editor.suggest.insertMode` setting that allows users to define their preference. We ask extension authors to please adopt this API quickly because we have plans to make insert and replace behavior more visible in the next release.

### Refined CallHierarchyProvider

We have made a small tweak to [CallHierarchyProvider#prepareCallHierarchy](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/8486d683444d324eaaa53ec41e5be7b47fd47a6a/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L4027) so that it can now return one or many `CallHierarchyItem` elements. The `many` option is new and helps when asking for the call hierarchy on an element that has multiple overloads.

### Creation options exposed on Terminals

The `Terminal` object has a new `creationOptions` property that can be used by extensions to identify how it was created.

### Language specific settings

Extensions can now contribute a setting that can be language overridable using the new configuration scope `language-overridable`.

Example:

```json
"contributes": {
	"configuration": {
				"title": "sample",
				"properties": {
					"sample.languageSetting": {
						"type": "boolean",
						"scope": "language-overridable"
					}
		}
	}
}
```

Configuration API is enhanced to support these settings. You can read and update these settings using the API by passing the necessary `languageId`.

Example:

```ts
/**
 * Read language configuration.
 */
const textDocumentConfiguration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('sample', {resource, languageId});
textDocumentConfiguration.get('languageSetting');

/**
 * Override configuration under language
 */
textDocumentConfiguration.update('languageSetting', false, ConfigurationTarget.Global, true);

/**
 * Listen language configuration changes
 */
workspace.onDidChangeConfiguration(e => {
	if(e.affectsConfiguration('sample.languageSetting',  {resource, languageId}) {
	}
});
```

For more information refer to the [Confuguration API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/be0aca7188ec6a76e7c2379758c0fbc1e9c21f7b/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L8753)

### Contribute to Extension context menu

You can now contribute commands to the extension's context menu in Extensions viewlet using the new menu location `extension/context`.

Example:

```json
"contributes": {
	"commands": [
		{
			"command": "extension.helloWorld",
			"title": "Hello World"
		}
	]
	"menus": {
		"extension/context": [
			{
				"command": "extension.helloWorld",
				"group": "2_configure",
				"when": "extensionStatus==installed",
			}
		]
	}
}
```

![Extension Context Menu Action](images/1_42/extension-context-menu-action.png)

Id of the extension is passed as an argument when the command is run.

Example:

``` ts
vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.helloWorld', (extensionId) => {
	vscode.window.showInformationMessage(extensionId);
});
```

Following predefined contexts are supported which you can use in `when` condition of the command.

- `extensionStatus==installed`
- `isBuiltinExtension`


### Debug APIs

* Support to implement debug adapter inside extension - TODO@weinand
* new resolveDebugConfigurationWithSubstitutedVariables hook - TODO@weinand

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Add workspace edit metadata

The Refactor Preview support that's now in VS Code comes with a new, optional API proposal. It allows you to classify changes of a workspace edit. For example, you can define whether changes need user confirmation or add a description such as "Renames in strings and comments". The proposal can be tracked [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77728) and its current design is around the [`WorkspaceEditMetadata`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/bd9dc9bfd2b7cf9c694af1cf1607647d0dd08cb8/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L1437) interface.

## Language Server Protocol

The 3.15 version of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/) is now available. We also released the corresponding npm modules for the [VS Code LSP client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-languageclient) and for [LSP servers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-languageserver) written in Node.js. The latest version of the libraries contains a proposed specification and implementation for semantic tokens.

The LSP Web site now hosts a preliminary version of the [Language Server Index Format specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsif/0.4.0/specification/) as well as a corresponding [LSIF overview](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overviews/lsif/overview/).

## Browser support

### Drag and drop files into the editor

When using VS Code in a browser, you can now drop local files into the editor area to open them as dirty (unsaved) files with the contents of the files.

![In-browser support for drag and drop](images/1_42/web-dnd.gif)

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command ID
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditor)`|Open Next Recently Used Editor|`workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditor`
`kb(workbench.action.openPreviousRecentlyUsedEditor)`|Open Previously Used Editor|`workbench.action.openPreviousRecentlyUsedEditor`
`kb(workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup)`|Open Next Recently Used Editor in Group|`workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`

`kb(workbench.action.quickOpenPreviousRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup)`|Open Previously Used Editor in Group via Picker|`workbench.action.quickOpenPreviousRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`
`kb(workbench.action.quickOpenLeastRecentlyUsedEditor)`|Open Least Used Editor via Picker|`workbench.action.quickOpenLeastRecentlyUsedEditor`
`kb(workbench.action.quickOpenLeastRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup)`|Open Least Used Editor in Group via Picker|`workbench.action.quickOpenLeastRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`

## Engineering

### TSLint to ESLint migration

VS Code is mostly written in TypeScript. In addition to the compiler, we use linting to enforce certain style and engineering rules. In the past, we have used TSLint for that task, but roughly a year ago, the maintainers of TSLint [announced](https://medium.com/palantir/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9) its deprecation in favor of ESLint.

This milestone we have migrated to ESLint - that includes our [lint-configuration](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/2c92f67ec5dcfd58180a6193ed077594d9fe0740/.eslintrc.json) and our [custom rules](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/50d1626b9e2fef19a98b549d07c67e0e76f6a43d/build/lib/eslint/). Last but not least, we have also updated `yo code` so that new TypeScript extensions are also checked by ESLint.
