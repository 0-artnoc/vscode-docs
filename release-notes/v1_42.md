# January 2020 (version 1.42)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.42 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87479)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22December%2FJanuary+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Limit the number of open editors

There are new settings to limit the maximum number of editors that are open at the one time.

* `workbench.editor.limit.enabled`: Enable this feature (off by default).
* `workbench.editor.limit.perEditorGroup`: Whether to apply the limit per editor group or across all groups.
* `workbench.editor.limit.value`: The maximum number of open editors (10 by default).

If enabled, VS Code will close the least recently used editor when you open a new editor. Below you can see the behavior when the limit is set to 3:

![Open editor limit](images/1_42/editor-limit.gif)

*Theme: [Nord](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code)*

**Note:** Dirty editors (files with unsaved changes) are never automatically closed but still count in the total number of open editors.

### Untitled editor improvements

Untitled editors in VS Code are text buffers that have not yet been saved to disk. You can leave them open for as long as you like and all text content is stored and restored between restarts.

Untitled editors were given generic names such as `Untitled-1` and counting upwards. In this release, untitled editors will use the content of the first line of the document for the editor title along the generic name as part of the description:

![Untitled file title using first line of text](images/1_42/untitled-title2.gif)

*Theme: [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme)*

**Note:** If the first line is empty or does not contain any words, the title will fall back to `Untitled-*` as before.

By default, untitled files do not have a specific language mode configured. VS Code has a setting, `files.defaultLanguage`, to configure a default language for untitled files. With this release, the setting can take a new value `{activeEditorLanguage}` that will dynamically use the language mode of the currently active editor instead of a fixed default.

In addition, when you copy and paste text into an untitled editor, VS Code will now automatically change the language mode of the untitled editor if the text was copied from a VS Code editor:

![Untitled file language mode dynamically set](images/1_42/untitled-copy2.gif)

*Theme: [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme)*

**Note:** If the untitled editor already has a language mode specified, pasting text will not change it.

### Navigate most recently used editors

With this release, there is now a list of most recently used editors across all editor groups. An editor is considered recently used when it either opens as the active editor or becomes the new active editor if already opened. Once an editor is closed, it is removed from this list.

One application of this list is the new `edt mru` picker that you can open through the new **View: Show All Editors By Most Recently Used** (`workbench.action.showAllEditorsByMostRecentlyUsed`) command:

![MRU editor list](images/1_42/editor-mru.png)

You can add keyboard shortcuts to quickly navigate in this picker without using the mouse. For example, below is a keybinding to so that `kbstyle(Ctrl+Tab)` and `kbstyle(Ctrl+Shift+Tab)` navigates across editors of all groups (instead of only within the active group as the default keybindings do):

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+tab",
    "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenPreviousRecentlyUsedEditor",
    "when": "!inEditorsPicker"
},
{
    "key": "ctrl+shift+tab",
    "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenLeastRecentlyUsedEditor",
    "when": "!inEditorsPicker"
}
```

If you want to navigate the list without using a picker, there are new commands:

* **View: Open Next Recently Used Editor** (`workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditor`)
* **View: Open Previous Recently Used Editor** (`workbench.action.openPreviousRecentlyUsedEditor`)

To differentiate which editor navigation commands work with a picker and which ones don't, the behavior of some existing commands has changed. Specifically, the **Recently Used Editor in Group** commands no longer use a picker:

* **View: Open Next Recently Used Editor in Group** (`workbench.action.openNextRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`)
* **View: Open Previous Recently Used Editor in Group** (`workbench.action.openPreviousRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`)

Use **View: Quick Open Previous Recently Used Editor in Group** (`workbench.action.quickOpenPreviousRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`) and **View: Quick Open Least Recently Used Editor in Group** (`workbench.action.quickOpenLeastRecentlyUsedEditorInGroup`) for picker-based navigation.

### Changed default settings to restore all windows on restart

VS Code's setting for restoring windows on startup has changed to restore all windows by default. If you want to go back to the previous behavior, configure `"window.restoreWindows": "one"`.

### Ignore save conflicts

VS Code has a built-in mechanism to show an error when you try to save a dirty file that has been changed outside of VS Code or by another program (for example Git):

![Save Conflict](images/1_42/save-conflict.png)

The motivation is to inform you that saving will overwrite the contents on disk even though the file was changed after the file became dirty. Clicking the **Compare** button lets you review your change along with the version on disk and either overwrite or revert the file.

In cases where you know that the changes on disk can be overwritten, there is now an **Overwrite** button directly on the notification. You can also configure `files.saveConflictResolution` globally or per workspace or file type to disable this behaviour altogether.

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

## Contributions to extensions

### Java debugger supports Data Breakpoints

The [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug) extension  now supports [Data Breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38#_debugging), introduced in 1.38. This feature allows you to create breakpoints that will get hit when the value of the underlying variable changes.

Below you can see the debugger breaks when the `Owner.telephone` string changes:

![Data Breakpoints Java](images/1_42/data-breakpoints.png)

### Java Call Hierarchy view

The [Language Support for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) extension now supports a [Call Hierarchy](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_40#_extension-authoring) view, which shows all calls from or to a function and allows you to drill into callers of callers and call of calls.

Right-click on a symbol and select **Peek -> Peek Call Hierarchy** to see the call hierarchy:

![Call Hierarchy Java](images/1_42/call-hierarchy.png)

## Extension authoring

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

## Browser support

### Drag and drop files into the editor

When using VS Code in a browser, you can now drop local files into the editor area to open them as dirty (unsaved) files with the contents of the files.
