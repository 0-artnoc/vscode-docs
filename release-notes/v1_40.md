## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.40 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82194)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Control the sizing behavior when splitting editors

A new setting `workbench.editor.splitSizing` controls the size of editors when splitting them. By default, the size will be distributed evenly among all editors as shown below:

![split-distribute](images/1_40/split-distribute.gif)

Change this setting to `split` for the current editor to be split in half and doesn't affect the size of other editors:

### Disable GPU acceleration

We have heard issue reports from users that seem to originate from how the GPU is used to render VS Code's UI. These users have a much better experience when running VS Code with the additional `--disable-gpu` command line argument. Running with this argument will disable the GPU hardware acceleration and fall back to a software renderer.

To make life easier, it is now possible to set this flag as a setting so that it does not have to be added to the command line each time:

* Open the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`).
* Run the **Preferences: Configure Runtime Arguments** command.
* This command will open a `argv.json` file to configure runtime arguments. You might see some default arguments there already.
* Add `"disable-hardware-acceleration": true`.
* Restart VS Code.

**Note:** Do not use this setting unless you are seeing issues!

## Languages

### CSS media query symbols

In CSS/SCSS/Less files, media query symbols are now shown in the Outline view, the breadcrumb path, and the **Go to Symbols in File** list:

## Extension authoring

### vscode.env.uiKind

A new API `vscode.env.uiKind` was added so that an extension can know in which kind of UI is it running. To support running VS Code in a browser, the possible values are `UIKind.Web` and `UIKind.Desktop`.

### Call Hierarchy Provider API

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.


### Support IntelliSense replace mode

We are working on a feature that allows users to decide if suggestions should replace existing text or just be inserted. Eg. accepting `console` inside `con|st` can result in `console` (replace) or `consolest` (insert). Both modes have merit and it eventually boils down to the current context and user preference. For this feature to work best we need extensions tell us what to do. Therefore we are proposing to add a new type to the `CompletionItem#range` property, namely changing it like this:

```ts
interface CompletionItem {
  range?: Range | { insert: Range; replace: Range; };
}
```

The range continues to be optional or be a simple range but it can also be two ranges: one for insert and one for replace. See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/10266 for more details.

## Engineering

### Run VS Code Web out of sources

There is now a minimal version of VS Code that can run in a browser and it is available for development and testing purposes. The Web version is still missing some features and is under active development.

In your local fork of the [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) repository, execute `yarn web` from the command line and access `http://localhost:8080/`. For more details about cloning and building the vscode repo, see the [setup instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute).

![yarn-web](images/1_40/yarn-web.png)

**Note:** Do not use this test version for any development. The intent is to allow the community to contribute changes back to VS Code Web to improve the overall experience in the browser.
