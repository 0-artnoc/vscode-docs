## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.40 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82194)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

----


Welcome to the October 2019 release of Visual Studio Code. As announced in the [October iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82194), we focused on housekeeping our GitHub issues and pull requests as documented in our [issues grooming guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Grooming). Across all of our VS Code repositories, we closed (either triaged or fixed) **4622** issues, which is even more than during our last housekeeping iteration from [September 2018](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_28) where we closed **3918** issues. While we closed issues, you created **2195** new issues. This resulted in a net reduction of **2427** issues. The main [vscode repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) now has 2162 open feature requests and 725 open bugs. In addition, we closed **287** pull requests. As part of this effort we have also tuned our process and updated the [issue triaging document](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issues-Triaging).

Same as last year we used the [live tracker](https://vscode-issue-tracker.netlify.com/) from [Benjamin Lannon](https://github.com/lannonbr) to track our progress:

![Burn down of issues](images/1_40/october-issue-grooming.png)

During this housekeeping milestone, we addressed several feature requests and community [pull requests](#thank-you) also resulted in new features.


## Workbench

### Activity Bar indicator

We've introduced a new indicator for the active item in Activity Bar to make it stand out better and increase readability. We also slightly tuned the inactive foreground colors for a stronger contrast with the active element.

![Active Activity Bar indicator](images/1_40/activity-bar-indicator.gif)

You can control the active indicator via the new color token, `activityBar.activeBorder`. We also introduced an optional background color for the active element, `activityBar.activeBackground`, and when configured can look like so:

![Active Activity Bar indicator custom background](images/1_40/activity-bar-indicator-2.png)

### Themeable window border

We've introduced two new theme colors, `window.activeBorder` and `window.inactiveBorder`, for providing a border around the VS Code window. The `window.activeBorder` applies to the active (focused) window, while the `window.inactiveBorder` applies to inactive (unfocused) windows. These new colors do not inherit from any color, so they must either be provided by the theme or by the `workbench.colorCustomizations` setting. If only one color is specified, a border with that color will be applied to both active and inactive windows.

![Animated image showing the use of the new window border colors](images/1_40/window-border.gif)

### Control the sizing behavior when splitting editors

A new setting `workbench.editor.splitSizing` controls the size of editors when splitting them. By default, the size will be distributed evenly among all editors as shown below:

![splitSizing distribute](images/1_40/split-distribute.gif)

Change this setting to `split` for the current editor to be split in half and doesn't affect the size of other editors:

![splitSizing split](images/1_40/split-split.gif)

### Type filters for outline and breadcrumbs

There are new settings to configure what symbols the Outline view and breadcrumb navigation should show. The settings are called `outline.showVariables`, `outline.showFunctions`, etc. and `breadcrumbs.showVariables` respectively.

![Filtered Outline view](images/1_40/outline_filtered.png)

The screen shot above shows the Outline view configured to not show local variables and you can see that the variable `hidden` isn't shown.

Note that it's up to the language extension to assign the type of a symbol. You can hover over the symbol label in the Outline view to which type is being used (in parentheses).

### Disable GPU acceleration

We have heard issue reports from users that seem to originate from how the GPU is used to render VS Code's UI. These users have a much better experience when running VS Code with the additional `--disable-gpu` command-line argument. Running with this argument will disable the GPU hardware acceleration and fall back to a software renderer.

To make life easier, it is now possible to set this flag as a setting so that it does not have to be added to the command line each time:

* Open the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`).
* Run the **Preferences: Configure Runtime Arguments** command.
* This command will open a `argv.json` file to configure runtime arguments. You might see some default arguments there already.
* Add `"disable-hardware-acceleration": true`.
* Restart VS Code.

**Note:** Do not use this setting unless you are seeing issues!

### List and tree keyboard scrolling

You can now press `kb(list.scrollUp)` and `kb(list.scrollDown)` to scroll lists and trees using the keyboard. If horizontal scrolling is enabled, `kb(list.scrollLeft)` and `kb(list.scrollRight)` will also scroll horizontally.

## Editor

### `files.eol` per language

The `files.eol` setting can now also be set per language. For example you could define that all files of 'mylanguage' use `\n` as the default end-of-line sequence for all new files.

```jsonc
"[mylanguage]": {
   "files.eol": "\n"
}
```

The end-of-line sequence is used for new files. For existing files the existing end-of-line sequence is always preserved. To change the end-of-line sequence for an existing file, use the `Change End Of Line Sequence` command.

Using that mechanism, the default end-of-line sequence for shellscript if now defined as `\n`.


### Minimap scaling and improved font rendering

A new setting `editor.minimap.scale` configures the minimap's size to one of several constant values, particularly useful for high DPI or ultra-wide displays. Also, the rendering of the minimap's font is now smoother and clearer.

![Animated image showing the ability to resize the minimap](images/1_40/minimap-scaling.gif)

### Control hover from the keyboard

There is a new command **Show Control Hover** for better accessibility of the detailed hover widget, which can be triggered by hovering a symbol with the mouse and pressing the control key. Previously, only the command **Show Hover** was provided, which is equivalent to hovering the mouse cursor over a symbol. Now, with **Show Control Hover**, the detailed hover information can be shown via the keyboard.

![Animated image showing the use of the new Show Control Hover command](images/1_40/control-hover.gif)

## Integrated Terminal

### Chords are now supported by default

The new setting `terminal.integrated.allowChords` (default `true`) allows keybindings that are part of a chord keybinding to skip the terminal for evaluation and instead get handled by VS Code (bypassing the `terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell` allow list).

Note that the same limitations around keybindings in the terminal still apply; the chord keybinding with the highest priority will be considered when making this evaluation. For example, if an extension contributes keybinding `kbstyle(Ctrl+M A)` and you have the following defined in your `keybindings.json` file:

```json
{"key": "ctrl+m a", "command": "workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal" },
{"key": "ctrl+m a", "command": "workbench.action.focusLastEditorGroup" }
```

`kbstyle(Ctrl+M, A)` will result in the `workbench.action.focusLastEditorGroup` command executing since it's the final keybinding and [user keybindings are of higher priority](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-rules) than extension contributed keybindings.

### Fast scroll support

The terminal now supports `kbstyle(Alt)` with mouse wheel to scroll faster based on the multiplier defined in the `editor.fastScrollSensitivity` setting.

### New "paste" option for right-click behavior

A new option has been added to the `rightClickBehavior` setting to always paste in the terminal on right-click:

```json
"terminal.integrated.rightClickBehavior": "paste"
```

### Double-click to select word uses more separator characters

The characters `,`, `:`, and `;` are now counted as word separators when double-clicking to select a word(s) in the terminal.

### Symlink cwds are no longer resolved

If a terminal's initial working directory is set to a symlink, the symlink will now be preserved in the terminal.

### Command navigation now works from the scroll position

Command navigation enables navigating between or selecting between commands that have been run in the terminal. This now takes the scroll position of the terminal into account so you can scroll, find the previous command, and the terminal will scroll up from the terminal's viewport (previously it would scroll from the bottom).

![Command navigation jumps to nearest command after scrolling](images/1_40/command-navigation.gif)

Command navigation is only bound on macOS by default as `kbstyle(Cmd + Up/Down)` and command selection as `kbstyle(Cmd + Shift + Up/Down)`.

Here are some example keybindings if you want to use this feature on Windows or Linux:

```jsonc
{
  // Terminal command tracking on Windows and Linux
  { "key": "ctrl+up",          "command": "workbench.action.terminal.scrollToPreviousCommand", "when": "terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "ctrl+down",        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.scrollToNextCommand", "when": "terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "ctrl+shift+up",    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.selectToPreviousCommand", "when": "terminalFocus" },
  { "key": "ctrl+shift+down",  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.selectToNextCommand", "when": "terminalFocus" },
}
```

## Tasks

### Task Quick Pick lists

The **Tasks: Configure Task** command now always skips the Quick Pick list of tasks if you only have one task defined. To extend this behavior to **Tasks: Run Task** and other task Quick Picks, you can set the `task.quickOpen.skip` setting to `true`.

The new setting `task.quickOpen.history` controls how many tasks are shown in the task Quick Pick as **recently used** tasks. Set `task.quickOpen.history` to `0` to disable the recent tasks section of the tasks Quick Pick.

Tasks that have a `detail` property will now show it in some task lists. You can turn off details in the task Quick Pick by setting `task.quickOpen.detail` to `false`.

### Option to run NPM scripts for a folder

When the setting `npm.enableRunFromFolder` is enabled, the File Explorer's context menu shows the command **Run NPM Script in Folder...** when a folder is selected. The command shows a Quick Pick list of the NPM scripts contained in this folder and you can select the script to be executed as a task.

### Slow task provider warning

When a task provider is running slowly, we now show a warning offering suggestions for how to avoid the slowdown. The warning can be disabled for individual task types, or it can be disabled for all tasks by setting `task.slowProviderWarning` to `false`.

![Slow task provider warning](images/1_40/slow-taskprovider.png)

### Disable all task providers

If you have all the tasks you care about in `tasks.json`, then you might want to disable all extension task providers to improve performance when you run tasks. It is good practice for individual extensions to provide a setting to disable their task providers, but you can now disable all task providers setting  `task.autoDetect` to `off`.

### Problem matcher prompt

In the past, any task without a problem matcher would need to have an empty problem matcher set in `tasks.json` to skip the problem matcher prompt. Now, you can use `task.problemMatchers.neverPrompt` to disable the problem matcher prompt for all tasks or for specific task types. There's also a new option in the problem matcher prompt to disable the prompt.

![Problem matcher prompt drop-down](images/1_40/task-problemmatcher-prompt.png)

## Source Control

### Highlight file on active editor change

The Source Control view will now automatically highlight the active editor file in its tree/list view:

![SCM view highlighting the active file](images/1_40/scm-highlight.gif)

### Git: Improved untracked files management

There's now a way to manage untracked files separately by using the **Git: Untracked Changes** setting. Choose the `separate` option if you'd like to see untracked files in a separate resource group. Choose `hidden` if you'd like to never see them. The default commit action will adjust itself to this setting and will only include untracked changes in a commit when using the `mixed` setting value.

![Git untracked files](images/1_40/untracked.gif)

### Git: Automatic commit message on merge commits

Whenever VS Code detects you're in a middle of a git merge commit, it will automatically populate the commit input box with Git's default commit message.

![Git merge commit message](images/1_40/conflict.png)

### Git: Reveal in Explorer

There's now a context menu action **Reveal in Explorer** to reveal files in the File Explorer, from a Git repository in the Source Control view.

![Git Reveal in Explorer](images/1_40/reveal-in-explorer.png)

### Git: Clone progress

The clone operation now supports displaying progress in the bottom-right corner notification:

![Git clone progress](images/1_40/clone.gif)

## Debugging

### Breakpoints can be shown in overview ruler

To make life easier when working with breakpoints in large files, it is now possible to show breakpoints in the editor's overview ruler by enabling the new setting `debug.showBreakpointsInOverviewRuler`.

### PreLaunch tasks for compound debug configurations

Today every debug configuration can specify a task to be run before the debug session is started via the `preLaunchTask` attribute. This works well when debugging a single program, but it gets unwieldy when using compound configurations where multiple programs are involved.

In this milestone, we've added support for a `preLaunchTask` per compound debug configuration. With this addition, a single task can build all debug targets before the individual debug sessions are started. In case of a build error, no session is started.

## Languages

### CSS media query symbols

In CSS/SCSS/Less files, media query symbols are now shown in the Outline view, the breadcrumb path, and the **Go to Symbols in File** list:

![CSS media query symbols](images/1_40/css-media-query-symbols.png)

### typescript.tsserver.maxTsServerMemory

If you are working with a large TypeScript project containing thousands of files, the new `typescript.tsserver.maxTsServerMemory` setting lets you increase the maximum memory usage for the TypeScript server that powers IntelliSense.

## Extension authoring

### vscode.env.uiKind

A new API `vscode.env.uiKind` was added so that an extension can know in which kind of UI is it running. To support running VS Code in a browser, the possible values are `UIKind.Web` and `UIKind.Desktop`.

### Call Hierarchy Provider API

We have finalized the call hierarchy provider API: [CallHierarchyProvider](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/3a5209ec6474137f69078727f7fe255c97fb8795/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L3983-L4021). It supports the **Peek Call Hierarchy** feature, which finds callers and calls of functions, methods, etc.

### Task CustomExecution

The `CustomExecution` task type API has been finalized. If a shell or process task isn't suitable for your task, you can use a `CustomExecution` task to execute a callback in your extension. Learn more in the [task provider extension guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/task-provider).

### Debug API: "consoleMode" option for "startDebugging" request

In the last milestone, we had introduced a [new proposed API](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_39#_startdebugging-consolemode-option-to-merge-debug-consoles)
for controlling whether a hierarchy of debug sessions share a single Debug Console or use individual consoles. This API has now become official so you can use it in extensions published on the Marketplace.

### Icon color tokens

We're excited to finally introduce new color tokens for our icons. We're slowly adding these for certain areas, below is the first batch.

**Symbols**

These icons appear in the Outline view, breadcrumb navigation, and suggest widget.

- `symbolIcon.arrayForeground`
- `symbolIcon.booleanForeground`
- `symbolIcon.classForeground`
- `symbolIcon.colorForeground`
- `symbolIcon.constructorForeground`
- `symbolIcon.constantForeground`
- `symbolIcon.enumeratorForeground`
- `symbolIcon.enumeratorMemberForeground`
- `symbolIcon.eventForeground`
- `symbolIcon.fieldForeground`
- `symbolIcon.fileForeground`
- `symbolIcon.folderForeground`
- `symbolIcon.functionForeground`
- `symbolIcon.interfaceForeground`
- `symbolIcon.keyForeground`
- `symbolIcon.keywordForeground`
- `symbolIcon.methodForeground`
- `symbolIcon.moduleForeground`
- `symbolIcon.namespaceForeground`
- `symbolIcon.nullForeground`
- `symbolIcon.numberForeground`
- `symbolIcon.objectForeground`
- `symbolIcon.operatorForeground`
- `symbolIcon.packageForeground`
- `symbolIcon.propertyForeground`
- `symbolIcon.referenceForeground`
- `symbolIcon.snippetForeground`
- `symbolIcon.stringForeground`
- `symbolIcon.structForeground`
- `symbolIcon.textForeground`
- `symbolIcon.typeParameterForeground`
- `symbolIcon.unitForeground`
- `symbolIcon.variableForeground`

![Symbol icon colors](images/1_40/icon-symbols.png)

**Problems and Notifications**

We've set the default colors for the problems and notifications icons to inherit from the editor foreground colors, so if you change those colors, it will inherit to the other areas:

![Problem icon colors](images/1_40/icon-editor.png)

You can also explicitly set the icon colors for the Problems panel and Notifications:

- `problemsErrorIcon.foreground`
- `problemsWarningIcon.foreground`
- `problemsInfoIcon.foreground`
- `notificationsErrorIcon.foreground`
- `notificationsInfoIcon.foreground`
- `notificationsWarningIcon.foreground`

**Lightbulb**

The lightbulb icons are also themeable:

- `editorLightBulb.foreground`
- `editorLightBulbAutoFix.foreground`

![Lightbulb icon colors](images/1_40/icon-lightbulb.png)

### vscode.env.asExternalUri

The `vscode.env.asExternalUri` API allows an extension to resolve an **external** URI - such as a `http:` or `https:` URI - from where the extension is running to a URI for the same resource on the client machine. This is a companion to the `vscode.env.openExternal` API, except instead of opening the resolved URI using an external program, it returns the result to extensions.

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import * as http from 'http';

const PORT = 3000;

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  startLocalServer(PORT);

  context.subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand('example.command', async () => {
      const resolved = vscode.env.asExternalUri(vscode.Uri.parse(`http://localhost:${PORT}`));
      vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Resolved to: ${resolved} on client and copied to clipboard`);
      vscode.env.clipboard.writeText(resolved.toString());
  }));
}

function startLocalServer(port: number) {
  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end('Hello world!');
  });
  server.on('clientError', (err, socket) => {
    socket.end('HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\r\n\r\n');
  });
  server.listen(port);
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Started local server on port: ${port}`);
}
```

For `http:` and `https:` and URIs, `asExternalUri` is a no-op if the extension is running on the client machine. However, if the extension is running remotely, `vscode.env.asExternalUri` automatically establishes a port forwarding tunnel from the local machine to `target` on the remote and returns a local URI to the tunnel.

If `asExternalUri` is called with a `vscode.env.uriScheme` URI, then it returns a URI that - if opened in a browser (for example via `openExternal`) - will result in the registered URI handler being triggered.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Support IntelliSense replace mode

We are working on a feature that allows users to decide if suggestions should replace existing text or just be inserted. For example, accepting `console` inside `con|st` can result in `console` (replace) or `consolest` (insert). Both modes have merit and it eventually depends on the current context and user preference. For this feature to work best, we need extensions tell us what to do. Therefore we are proposing to add a new type to the `CompletionItem#range` property, namely changing it like this:

```ts
interface CompletionItem {
  range?: Range | { insert: Range; replace: Range; };
}
```

The range continues to be optional or be a simple range but it can also be two ranges: one for insert and one for replace. See [Issue #10266](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/10266) for more details.

### Task detail

There is a new property on `Task` that task providers can use to add a `detail` to the task when it is shown in UI. You can also use the detail in `tasks.json`. The built-in npm extension uses the task detail to show which npm script will run.

![tasks with detail](images/1_40/task-detail.png)

### Support for passing `WebviewPanelOptions` to Custom Editors

We continued our work on the [Custom Editor API proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82115) this iteration. Now the proposed `registerWebviewEditorProvider` function takes a set of `options` that let you enable [`retainContextWhenHidden`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview#retaincontextwhenhidden) and other features in custom editor webviews:

```ts
export function registerWebviewEditorProvider(
  viewType: string,
  provider: WebviewEditorProvider,
  options?: WebviewPanelOptions
): Disposable;
```

## Engineering

### Run VS Code Web out of sources

There is now a minimal version of VS Code that can run in a browser and it is available for development and testing purposes. The Web version is still missing some features and is under active development.

In your local fork of the [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) repository, execute `yarn web` from the command line and access `http://localhost:8080/`. For more details about cloning and building the vscode repo, see the [setup instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute).

![VS Code Web running in a browser](images/1_40/yarn-web.png)

**Note:** Do not use this test version for any development. The intent is to allow the community to contribute changes back to VS Code Web to improve the overall experience in the browser.

### Building VS Code with TypeScript 3.7

VS Code is now built using TypeScript 3.7. This is an exciting update as it lets us use [optional chaining (`?.`)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-7-beta/) in our codebase (as well as brining other many improvements.)

You can start using TypeScript 3.7 features in VS Code today just by installing the [JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next).

### Electron 6.0 Update

In this milestone, we finished the exploration of bundling Electron 6 into VS Code, making it the first time this Electron version ships with stable. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chromium 76.0.3809.146 and Node.js 12.4.0 (a major leap forward from our current version with Chromium 69 and Node.js 10.11.0).

We have started to explore updating to Electron 7, which we hope to push to Insiders soon.
