## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.40 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82194)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### New setting to control the sizing behavior when splitting editors

A new setting `workbench.editor.splitSizing` allows to control the size of editors when splitting them. By default, the size will be distributed among all editors as shown below:

![split-distribute](images/1_40/split-distribute.gif)

Change this setting to split to get a sizing behavior where the space of the editor to split is split in half instead of distributing it:

### New setting to disable GPU acceleration

We have heard reports from users that see issues with VSCode that seem to originate from how the GPU is used to render VSCode's UI. These users had a much better experience when running VSCode from the command line with an additional `--disable-gpu` argument. Running with this argument will disable the GPU hardware acceleration and fallback to a software renderer.

To make life easier, it is now possible to set this flag as a setting so that it does not have to be added to the command line each time:
* bring up the commad palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`)
* find `Developer: Configure Runtime Arguments`
* this will open a `argv.json` file to configure runtime arguments (you might see some default arguments from us in there already)
* add `"disable-hardware-acceleration": true`
* restart

**Note:** never change this setting if you are not seeing any issues!


## Languages

### CSS Media Query symbols

In CSS/SCSS/Less files, Media Query are now shown in the Outline View, the breadcrumb and the `Go to Symbols in File...` command list:

## Extension authoring

### vscode.env.uiKind

A new API `vscode.env.uiKind` was added that allows an extension to figure out from what kind of UI the extension is being used from. In preparation for supporting running VS Code in a browser, the possible values are `UIKind.Desktop` and `UIKind.Web`.

## Engineering

### Allow to run VSCode Web out of sources

There is now a minimal version of VSCode that can open in a browser for development and testing purposes. A lot of things will not work and we are still working on improving the capabilities.

Simply execute `yarn web` ([setup instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute)) from the command line and access `http://localhost:8080/`

![yarn-web](images/1_40/yarn-web.png)

**Note:** do not use this test version for any development. The intent is to allow for the community to contribute changes back to VSCode Web to improve the overall experience in the browser.

## Thank you
