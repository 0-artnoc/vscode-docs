## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.41 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/83930)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

## Workbench

### Faster read/write file performance for remote scenarios

Reading and writing files (e.g. from the text editor) should now be faster for scenarios where the file system is remote and the latency is high (e.g. using VSCode in a browser with a slow connection or being connected to a remote host that is not in the same region). We switched to a stream based implementation for reads and writes that greatly reduces communication overhead compared to our previous solution.

### Improved font rendering (Windows, Linux)

When we updated to Electron 6 last milestone, a lot of users reported back that font rendering regressed for them. Specifically, fonts did not render as smooth anymore as they used to. We have immediately addressed the issue in the editor and the fix was made available on a recovery release quickly. However, other areas in the workbench still suffered from less than ideal font rendering.

In this release you can expect much improved font rendering in all parts of the workbench (Windows and Linux). Below screenshot shows a comparision of the before and after (zoomed in to show the difference). In particular, while previously lots of workbench parts rendered using greyscale antialiasing, they now render with subpixel antialiasing.

### Support to edit left-hand side editor in diffs

If you compare 2 editors that are editable (e.g. from the file explorer), the left hand side is now also editable and can be saved (e.g. via `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`).

*Note:* You can enable auto save (File | Auto Save) if you are getting tired of pressing `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`.

### Support to save from peek editors

If you bring up a peek editor and type into it, you can now save it via `kb(workbench.action.files.save)` if the focus is inside that embedded editor.

*Note:* You can enable auto save (File | Auto Save) if you are getting tired of pressing `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`.

## Web

### Improved support for Firefox and Safari (macOS & iPadOS)

During this milestone we focused on improving the experience of VSCode for Web when using Firefox or Safari as browser. As such we fixed many issues in both browsers ([Firefox](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Afirefox+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22), [Safari](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asafari+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22)).

TODO@Pung mention iPadOS improvements.

### More support for features in `yarn web` version of VSCode

Last milestone we [introduced support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_40#_test-vs-code-running-in-a-browser) for running `yarn web` from our repository to bring up a version of VSCode that can run in the browser. This version is still meant to be used for testing issues in browsers and not for using productively.

This milestone we add a lot more features that can now be tested:
* Debug
* Search
* Tasks
* Problems

Here is a video showing the new features in action:

## Extension authoring

### Strict getWordRangeAtPosition

The [`TextDocument.getWordRangeAtPosition`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/58479e80ab899402283b522da173c34867d7c78f/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L224) got a little more strict and instead of ignoring invalid regular expressions, those that match the empty string, it now throws an error.
