## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.41 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/83930)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Improved font rendering (Windows, Linux)

When we updated to Electron 6 last milestone, many users reported that font rendering regressed for them. Specifically, fonts did not render as smoothly as they used to. We immediately addressed the issue in the editor and the fix was made available in a 1.40 recovery release. However, other areas in the workbench still suffered from less than ideal font rendering.

In this release, we improved font rendering in all parts of the workbench (Windows and Linux). The screenshots below show a before and after comparison (zoomed in to show the difference). In particular, many UI elements of the workbench were rendered using greyscale antialiasing and they now render with subpixel antialiasing.

### Edit left-hand side in diffs

If you compare 2 editors that are editable (for example, from the File Explorer by comparing 2 files or running a global Search & Replace), the left-hand side is now also editable and can be saved (`kb(workbench.action.files.save)`).

**Note:** You can enable Auto Save (**File** > **Auto Save**) if you are tired of pressing `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`.

### Save from peek editors

If you bring up a peek view and type into it, you can now save it via `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`, if the focus is inside that embedded editor.

### Faster read/write file performance for remote scenarios

Reading and writing files (from the text editor) should now be faster for scenarios where the file system is remote and the latency is high (for example when using VS Code in a browser with a slow connection or being connected to a remote host that is not in the same region). We switched to a stream-based implementation for reads and writes that greatly reduces communication overhead.

## Browser support

### Improved support for Firefox and Safari (macOS & iPadOS)

During this milestone, we focused on improving the experience of VS Code running in a browser when using Firefox or Safari. We fixed many issues to support both browsers ([Firefox](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Afirefox+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22), [Safari](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asafari+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22)).

TODO@Pung mention iPadOS improvements.

### More features in `yarn web` setup

Last milestone, we [introduced support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_40#_test-vs-code-running-in-a-browser) for running `yarn web` from our repository to setup VS Code running in the browser. This setup is still meant to be used for testing issues in browsers and not for development.

This milestone we added more features that can be tested:

* Debug
* Search
* Tasks
* Problems

Here is a video showing the new features in action:

## Extension authoring

### Strict getWordRangeAtPosition

The [`TextDocument.getWordRangeAtPosition`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/58479e80ab899402283b522da173c34867d7c78f/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L224) API is now more strict and instead of ignoring invalid regular expressions which result in empty string matches, it will throw an error.

## Notable fixes

* [51039](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/51039): Diff editor closes when closing left hand side editor in other tab
* [83746](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/83746): Web: unable to drag and drop composites & views (activity bar, panel)
