## Workbench

### Edit left-hand side in diffs

If you compare 2 editors that are editable (for example, from the File Explorer by comparing 2 files or running a global Search & Replace), the left-hand side is now also editable and can be saved (`kb(workbench.action.files.save)`).

![Left-hand diff edit](images/1_41/save-diff.gif)

**Note:** You can enable Auto Save (**File** > **Auto Save**) if you are tired of pressing `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`.

### Save from peek editors

If you bring up a peek view and type into it, you can now save it via `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`, if the focus is inside that embedded editor.

### Faster read/write file performance for remote scenarios

Reading and writing files (from the text editor) should now be faster for scenarios where the file system is remote and the latency is high (for example when using VS Code in a browser with a slow connection or being connected to a remote host that is not in the same region). We switched to a stream-based implementation for reads and writes that greatly reduces communication overhead.

## Editor

### Code Navigation: Alternative Command

VS Code used to do nothing when calling 'Go to Definition' while already at the definition. With this release  alternative commands can be executed instead. For instance, for 'Go to Definition' this is 'Go to References' so which means when running 'Go to Definition' on a definition 'Go to References' in run instead.

This can be customized via the `editor.gotoLocation.alternativeDefinitionCommand`-setting, e.g. make the alternative of 'Go to Definition' be 'Go to Declaration' and vice versa. Or leave it empty when you prefer to old behaviour.

### Code Navigation: Peeking, Going, and Listing

Each 'Peek'-command now has a 'Go to'-counterpart and vice versa. For instance, there is 'Peek Implementations' and 'Go to Implementations'. Peek doesn't change the current editor and allows for a quick in-place look at source code. The capture below shows all implementations of the `ICommandService`-interface:

![Peek Implementations](images/1_41/peek-impl.gif)

In contrast, 'Go to Implementations' is about navigation and gets you to an implementation quickly. The capture below (using the `"editor.gotoLocation.multipleImplementations": "goto"`-setting) navigates to all implementations of the `ICommandService`-interface by repeatedly pressing `F12`:

![Go to Implementations](images/1_41/goto-impl.gif)

Theme: GitHub Sharp, Font: FiraCode

Last, but not least and just like 'Find All References', there is now 'Find All Implementation'. It presents the implementations as a stable list to the side of the editor. This can be used as a todo-list, e.g. when performing a refactoring that affects all implementations of an interface.

### Call Hierarchy Viewlet

The call hierarchy API is generally available and while language servers are busy implementing it we have added a 'Call Hierarchy View'. This complements the 'Peek Call Hierarchy' feature and shares the same view as 'Find All References' and 'Find All Implementations'. Select 'Show Call Hierarchy' from the context menu or the command palette and the viewlet shows like so:

![Call Hierarchy Viewlet](images/1_41/callhierarchy-view.png)

Theme: GitHub Sharp, Font: FiraCode

It allows you to drill into the callers from and calls of a symbol. It highlights calls in the active editor, allows to re-parent the viewlet from any children, and it keeps a history of previous runs.

### Language Specific Settings for Breadcrumbs and Outline filtering

Last milestone we have added the capability to filter certain type, like variables, from outline and breadcrumbs. This release refines this features and allows language-specific filtering, e.g. don't show TypeScript variables but do show JavaScript variables.

### IntelliSense keybindings on macOS

IntelliSense is usually triggered via `Ctrl+Space`. On macOS however, this keybinding is taken by the operating system when multiple input sources are configured. This often leads to confusion and users thinking IntelliSense is broken. There is two ways to handle this

* Use the new `Option+Escape` keybinding that we have added for macOS, or
* Disable Input Source switching via `Ctrl+Space` in Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Input Sources

## Integated terminal

### New experimental WebGL renderer

A new WebGL-based renderer is available for the terminal which boasts performance gains of up to 900%\* compared to the old canvas based approach. You can opt-in to use the new renderer with this setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.rendererType": "experimentalWebgl"
```

The speed improvements are attributed to many things but here are the highlights:

- WebGL allows us to talk more directly to the GPU, as opposed to going via the web platform's `CanvasRenderingContext2D` API.
- The renderer deals almost exclusively with numbers and typed arrays which are extremely fast, object and array creation is also kept to a minimum to avoid unnecessary garbage collection.
- _All_ characters are now cached in a texture atlas as opposed to just ascii with a very limited set of styles, this means repeated drawing of the same character is much faster.

We observed rendering of frames varying wildly based on a user's hardware/environment with the canvas renderer, each frame would typically take anywhere from 1ms to 40ms but could reach to over 200ms in extreme cases where hardware issues were a factor. So far WebGL seems way more consistent typically sitting in the 0.2ms to 2ms range:

![WebGL frames are much faster](images/1_41/webgl1.png)

Reliability is one of the things we expect to improve once this is integrated. With the canvas renderer, the browser would try to be clever and fallback to rendering on the CPU if there were problems with the GPU/canvas, but we never want that to happen as we have a DOM-based renderer which is much more suited for that. With WebGL it should either work as expected or fail hard (a webgl context cannot be acquired), in which case we can fallback to the DOM renderer.

Since rendering takes so much less time, the CPU is freed up to focus on parsing incoming data which results in more frames rendered and commands that run faster. The following screenshot was generated from running `ls -lR` inside the vs code repository:

![Commands run faster on the WebGL renderer](images/1_41/webgl2.png)

The new renderer also fixes a nasty bug with the canvas renderer where characters would get their sides clipped when they are larger than the cell size, this issue was most commonly observed with certain font on Linux with underscores.

### Minimum contrast ratio

Applications working with colors in the terminal can be tricky, they can use the following colors for text:

- The default foreground color
- A palette of 16 colors as defined by the terminal theme
- A set of 240 fixed colors
- Any rgb color (16 million)

The problem is the application doesn't know what the default background color or foreground color is and whether it will have good contrast or not and sometimes they draw colors that users have issues with.

To solve this problem the terminal can now change the foreground color of text dynamically to meet a certain contrast ratio. Just set the color to the desired contrast ratio ranging from 1 to 21:

```json
// 4.5 is recommended for baseline website accessibility
"terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio": 4.5
```

Then the colors will increase or decrease luminance until either the contrast ratio is met or the foreground becomes `#000000` or `#ffffff`.

## Browser support

### Improved support for Firefox and Safari (macOS & iPadOS)

During this milestone, we focused on improving the experience of VS Code running in a browser when using Firefox or Safari. We fixed many issues to support both browsers ([Firefox](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Afirefox+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22), [Safari](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asafari+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22)).

TODO@Pung mention iPadOS improvements.

### More features in `yarn web` setup

Last milestone, we [introduced support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_40#_test-vs-code-running-in-a-browser) for running `yarn web` from our repository to setup VS Code running in the browser. This setup is still meant to be used for testing issues in browsers and not for development.

This milestone we added more features that can be tested:

* Debug
* Search
* Tasks
* Problems

Here is a video showing the new features in action:

## Extension authoring

### Workspace File Events

There is new events for when files and folders change: `vscode.workspace.on[Will|Did]CreateFile`,`vscode.workspace.on[Will|Did]RenameFile`, and `vscode.workspace.on[Will|Did]DeleteFile`. The events are fired when files are created, renamed, or deleted from the explorer or from extensions via the `vscode.workspace.applyEdit(WorkspaceEdit)`-API but not when files change on disk or when files are modified via the `vscode.workspace.fs`-API.

An possible use-case for these events are language servers, for instance update the contents of a file before renaming it or updating project files after deletion/creation of files.

### SnipptString

The `SnippetString`-type has now a builder-method for choice-elements.

### Strict getWordRangeAtPosition

The [`TextDocument.getWordRangeAtPosition`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/58479e80ab899402283b522da173c34867d7c78f/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L224) API is now more strict and instead of ignoring invalid regular expressions which result in empty string matches, it will throw an error.

## Engineering

### Insiders available in the yum repository

The insiders build is now available in the yum repository and is automatically published just like with the apt repository. Follow the [instructions on the website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_rhel-fedora-and-centos-based-distributions) to set up the repo and install `code-insiders`.
