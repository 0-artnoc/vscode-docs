## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.41 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/83930)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Edit left-hand side in diffs

If you compare two editors that are editable (for example, from the File Explorer by comparing two files or running a global Search & Replace), the left-hand side is now also editable and can be saved (`kb(workbench.action.files.save)`).

![Left-hand diff edit](images/1_41/save-diff.gif)

**Note:** You can enable Auto Save (**File** > **Auto Save**) if you are tired of pressing `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`.

### Save from peek editors

If you bring up a peek view and type into it, you can now save it via `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`, if the focus is inside that embedded editor.

![Peek save](images/1_41/save-peek.gif)

### Faster read/write file performance for remote scenarios

Reading and writing files (from the text editor) should now be faster for scenarios where the file system is remote and the latency is high (for example when using VS Code in a browser with a slow connection or being connected to a remote host that is not in the same region). We switched to a stream-based implementation for reads and writes that greatly reduces communication overhead.

### Problems Panel

**More Filters**

More predefined filters are added to the problems panel. You can now filter problems by type and also see problems scoped to the current active file.

**Show current problem in Status bar**

You can now configure VS Code to show the current problem message in the status bar. This will allow you to see the summary of the problem that is selected in the opened file without any additional keyboard or mouse gestures.

**Note:** Enabling this feature needs enabling the setting `problems.showCurrentInStatus`.

**Flexible filter box layout**

Filter box in the problems panel adjusts its position nicely according to the panel's position and size.

## Editor

### Code navigation alternate commands

VS Code used to do nothing when selecting **Go to Definition** while already at the definition. With this release, alternate commands can be executed instead. For instance, **Go to Definition** can be mapped to run **Go to References**.

This is customized via the `editor.gotoLocation.alternativeDefinitionCommand` setting. For example, you can make the alternate for **Go to Definition** be **Go to Declaration** and vice versa. You can leave the setting empty if you prefer the old behavior.

### Peek, Go to, and Find All commands

Each **Peek** command now has a **Go to** counterpart. For instance, there is now both **Peek Implementations** and **Go to Implementations**. The Peek view doesn't change the current editor and allows for a quick in-place look at source code.

The video below shows all implementations of the `ICommandService` interface:

![Peek Implementations](images/1_41/peek-impl.gif)

Theme: GitHub Sharp, Font: FiraCode

In contrast, **Go to Implementations** is about navigation and gets you to an implementation quickly.

The video below (using the `"editor.gotoLocation.multipleImplementations": "goto"` setting) navigates to all implementations of the `ICommandService` interface by repeatedly pressing `kbstyle(12)`:

![Go to Implementations](images/1_41/goto-impl.gif)

Theme: GitHub Sharp, Font: FiraCode

Last but not least, similar to the **Find All References** command, there is now **Find All Implementations**. It presents the implementations as a stable list to the side of the editor. This can be used as a TODO list, for example when performing a refactoring that affects all implementations of an interface.

![Find All Implementations](images/1_41/find-impl.gif)

### Call Hierarchy view

The call hierarchy API is generally available and while language servers are busy implementing it, we have added a Call Hierarchy view. This complements the Peek Call Hierarchy feature and shares the same view as **Find All References** and **Find All Implementations**. Select **Show Call Hierarchy** from the context menu or the Command Palette to see the view:

![Call Hierarchy Viewlet](images/1_41/callhierarchy-view.png)

Theme: GitHub Sharp, Font: FiraCode

The Call Hierarchy view allows you to drill into the callers from and calls of a symbol. It highlights calls in the active editor, allows reparenting the view from any children, and it keeps a history of previous runs.

### Language-specific filtering for breadcrumbs and Outline view

Last milestone, we have added the capability to filter certain types, like variables, from the Outline view and breadcrumbs navigation. This release refines this features and allows language-specific filtering, for example don't show TypeScript variables but do show JavaScript variables.

![Language-specific filter for Outline view](images/1_41/lang-filter.gif)

Theme: GitHub Sharp, Font: Fira Code

### IntelliSense keyboard shortcuts on macOS

IntelliSense is usually triggered via `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`. On macOS however, this keyboard shortcut is taken by the operating system when multiple input sources are configured. This often leads to confusion and users thinking IntelliSense is broken. There are two ways to handle this:

* Use the new `kbstyle(Option+Esc)` keyboard shortcut that we have added for macOS.
* Disable Input Source switching via `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)` in your macOS preferences through **Preferences** > **Keyboard** > **Shortcuts** > **Input Sources**.

![macOS shortcuts](images/1_41/macos-shortcuts.png)

### Minimap decorations for errors, warnings, and content changes

Errors and warnings are now highlighted inline in the minimap. You can change the color of these decorations with the new `minimap.errorHighlight` and `minimap.warningHighlight` theme colors.

![Minimap error and warning decorations](images/1_41/minimap-errors-and-warnings.png)

Content changes decorations are also shown in the gutter of the minimap, and can be themed with the `minimapGutter.addedBackground`, `minimapGutter.modifiedBackground` and `minimapGutter.deletedBackground`. You can change the visibility of these decorations with the `scm.diffDecorations` setting.

![Minimap content change decorations](images/1_41/minimap-content-changes.png)

## Integrated terminal

### New experimental WebGL renderer

A new WebGL-based renderer is available for the terminal, which boasts performance gains of up to 900%\* compared to the old canvas-based approach. You can opt in to use the new renderer with this setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.rendererType": "experimentalWebgl"
```

The speed improvements are attributed to many things but here are the highlights:

* WebGL allows us to talk more directly to the GPU, as opposed to going via the web platform's `CanvasRenderingContext2D` API.
* The renderer deals almost exclusively with numbers and typed arrays, which are extremely fast. Object and array creation is also kept to a minimum to avoid unnecessary garbage collection.
* **All** characters are now cached in a texture atlas as opposed to just ASCII with a limited set of styles. This means repeated drawing of the same character is much faster.

We observed rendering of frames varying wildly based on a user's hardware/environment with the canvas renderer. Each frame would typically take anywhere from 1 ms to 40 ms but could reach to over 200 ms in extreme cases, where hardware issues were a factor. So far, WebGL seems much more consistent, typically sitting in the 0.2 ms to 2 ms range:

![WebGL frames are much faster](images/1_41/webgl1.png)

Reliability is one of the things we expect to improve once this is integrated. With the canvas renderer, the browser would try to be clever and fall back to rendering on the CPU if there were problems with the GPU/canvas, but we never want that to happen as we have a DOM-based renderer, which is much more suited for that. With WebGL, it should either work as expected or fail hard (a WebGL context cannot be acquired), in which case we can fall back to the DOM renderer.

Since rendering takes so much less time, the CPU is freed up to focus on parsing incoming data, which results in more frames rendered and commands that run faster. The following screenshot was generated from running `ls -lR` inside the vs code repository:

![Commands run faster on the WebGL renderer](images/1_41/webgl2.png)

The new renderer also fixes a nasty bug with the canvas renderer where characters would get their sides clipped when they are larger than the cell size. This issue was most commonly observed with certain fonts on Linux with underscores.

### Minimum contrast ratio

Applications working with colors in the terminal can be tricky, they can use the following colors for text:

* The default foreground color
* A palette of 16 colors as defined by the terminal theme
* A set of 240 fixed colors
* Any rgb color (16 million)

The problem is the application doesn't know what the default background color or foreground color is and whether it will have good contrast or not and sometimes they draw colors that users have issues with.

To solve this problem, the terminal can now change the foreground color of text dynamically to meet a certain contrast ratio. Set the color to the desired contrast ratio ranging from 1 to 21:

```json
// 4.5 is recommended for baseline website accessibility
"terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio": 4.5
```

Then the colors will increase or decrease luminance until either the contrast ratio is met or the foreground becomes `#000000` or `#ffffff`.

## Browser support

### Improved support for Firefox and Safari (macOS & iPadOS)

During this milestone, we focused on improving the experience of VS Code running in a browser when using Firefox or Safari. We fixed many issues to support both browsers ([Firefox](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Afirefox+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22), [Safari](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asafari+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22)).

<!-- TODO@Pung mention iPadOS improvements. -->

### More features available running in a browser

Last milestone, we [introduced support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_40#_test-vs-code-running-in-a-browser) for running `yarn web` from our repository to set up VS Code running in the browser. This setup is still meant to be used for testing issues in browsers and not for development.

This milestone we added more features that can be tested:

* Debug
* Search
* Tasks
* Problems

Here is a video showing the new features in action:

![VS Code running in a browser](images/1_41/yarn-web.gif)

## Debugging

We have introduced the setting `debug.showInlineBreakpointCandidates` that controls whether inline breakpoints candidate decorations should be shown in the editor while debugging. By default they are visible.

### UX improvements

#### Debug START view

We have introduced a new debug START view to make it easier for users to start and configure debugging in a new workspace.
Based on the active file we will choose the appropriate debug extension and make it possible to debug or run your app. For more elaborate debug and run configuration it is best to configure a `launch.json` file.

![debugStart](images/1_41/debug.gif)



#### Restart frame as an inline action in the CALL STACK view

To improve the discoverability of the Restart Frame action we have introduced it as an inline action in the CALL STACK view visible on hover. Restarting frames is a handy way to re-run the preceding code after a breakpoint is hit. If the debug extension does not support restarting frames we will not show this action.

![Restart frame](images/1_41/restart-frame.png)

#### Debug console: clearer indication of what is input and what is output

In order to distinguish input and output better in the debug console we have introduced opaque decorations to the left.

![Debug console decorations](images/1_41/repl-decorations.png)


## Extension authoring

### Workspace file events

There are new events for when files and folders change:

* `vscode.workspace.on[Will|Did]CreateFile`
* `vscode.workspace.on[Will|Did]RenameFile`
* `vscode.workspace.on[Will|Did]DeleteFile`

The events are fired when files are created, renamed, or deleted from the Explorer or from extensions via the `vscode.workspace.applyEdit(WorkspaceEdit)` API but not when files change on disk or when files are modified via the `vscode.workspace.fs` API.

A possible use case for these events is a language server, which might update the contents of a file before renaming it or update project files after deletion/creation of files.

### SnippetString

The `SnippetString` type has now a builder-method for choice-elements.

### Strict getWordRangeAtPosition

The [`TextDocument.getWordRangeAtPosition`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/58479e80ab899402283b522da173c34867d7c78f/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L224) API is now more strict and instead of ignoring invalid regular expressions that result in empty string matches, it will throw an error.

### Deprected string type for extensionKind

Extension authors can use `extnsionKind` property in `package.json` to indicate where the extension should run in the remote case. As of previous release (1.40), this value can be a string or an array. From this release this property supports only array value and the string type is deprecated. Please see the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions#incorrect-execution-location) for more information.

### Debug API

* extension API for creating debug URIs TODO@weinand

## Language Server Protocol

Proposed support got to provide a [call hierarchy](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/blob/dbaeumer/moreIntegrationTests/protocol/src/protocol.callHierarchy.proposed.ts#L1) via LSP.

## Extensions

### ESLint

The VS Code ESLint extension

- better support for ESLint 6.x: in most cases it shouldn't be necessary anymore to configure working directories when using ESLint 6.x.
- improved TypeScript detection: as soon as TypeScript is correctly configured inside ESLint there is no need anymore for an additional configuration of TypeScript ESLint inside of VS Code's `eslint.validate` setting. The same is true for HTML and VUE files.
- glob working directory support: projects that have a complex folder setup and do need to customize the working directories via `eslint.workingDirectories` can now use glob patterns instead of listing every project folder (e.g `code-*` will match all project folders starting with `code-`). In addition the extension now changes the working directory by default. If that needs to be disabled users can use the new `!cwd` property.
- improved auto fix on save: auto fix on save is now part of VS Code's code action on save infrastructure and computes all possible fixes in one round. It is customized via the `editor.codeActionsOnSave` setting. The setting supports the ESLint specific property `source.fixAll.eslint`. The extension also respects the generic property `source.fixAll`. For example
```json
	"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
		"source.fixAll": true
	}
```
turns auto fix on for all providers including ESLint. In contrast
```json
	"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
		"source.fixAll.eslint": true
	}
```
only turns it on for ESLint. You can also selectively disable ESLint via
```json
	"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
		"source.fixAll": true,
		"source.fixAll.eslint": false
	}
```
