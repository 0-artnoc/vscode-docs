## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.41 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/83930)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Improved font rendering (Windows, Linux)

When we updated to Electron 6 last milestone, many users reported that font rendering regressed for them. Specifically, fonts did not render as smoothly as they used to. We immediately addressed the issue in the editor and the fix was made available in a 1.40 recovery release. However, other areas in the workbench still suffered from less than ideal font rendering.

In this release, we improved font rendering in all parts of the workbench (Windows and Linux). The screenshots below show a before and after comparison (zoomed in to show the difference). In particular, many UI elements of the workbench were rendered using greyscale antialiasing and they now render with subpixel antialiasing.

Before and after:

### Edit left-hand side in diffs

If you compare 2 editors that are editable (for example, from the File Explorer by comparing 2 files or running a global Search & Replace), the left-hand side is now also editable and can be saved (`kb(workbench.action.files.save)`).

![Left-hand diff edit](images/1_41/save-diff.gif)

**Note:** You can enable Auto Save (**File** > **Auto Save**) if you are tired of pressing `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`.

### Save from peek editors

If you bring up a peek view and type into it, you can now save it via `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`, if the focus is inside that embedded editor.

### Faster read/write file performance for remote scenarios

Reading and writing files (from the text editor) should now be faster for scenarios where the file system is remote and the latency is high (for example when using VS Code in a browser with a slow connection or being connected to a remote host that is not in the same region). We switched to a stream-based implementation for reads and writes that greatly reduces communication overhead.

## Integated terminal

### New experimental WebGL renderer

A new WebGL-based renderer is available for the terminal which boasts performance gains of up to 900%\* compared to the old canvas based approach. You can opt-in to use the new renderer with this setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.rendererType": "experimentalWebgl"
```

The speed improvements are attributed to many things but here are the highlights:

- WebGL allows us to talk more directly to the GPU, as opposed to going via the web platform's `CanvasRenderingContext2D` API.
- The renderer deals almost exclusively with numbers and typed arrays which are extremely fast, object and array creation is also kept to a minimum to avoid unnecessary garbage collection.
- _All_ characters are now cached in a texture atlas as opposed to just ascii with a very limited set of styles, this means repeated drawing of the same character is much faster.

We observed rendering of frames varying wildly based on a user's hardware/environment with the canvas renderer, each frame would typically take anywhere from 1ms to 40ms but could reach to over 200ms in extreme cases where hardware issues were a factor. So far WebGL seems way more consistent typically sitting in the 0.2ms to 2ms range:

![WebGL frames are much faster](images/1_41/webgl1.png)

Reliability is one of the things we expect to improve since with the canvas renderer the browser would try to be clever and drop down to rendering on the CPU if there were problems with the GPU but we never want that to happen. With WebGL is should either work as expected or fail hard (a webgl context cannot be acquired) in which case we can fallback to the DOM-based renderer which is more friendly on the CPU.

Since rendering takes so much less time, the CPU is freed up to focus on parsing incoming data which results in more frames rendered and commands that run faster. The following screenshot was generated from running `ls -lR` inside the vs code repository:

![Commands run faster on the WebGL renderer](images/1_41/webgl2.png)

The new renderer also fixes a nasty bug with the canvas renderer where characters would get their sides clipped when they are larger than the cell size, this issue was most commonly observed with certain font on Linux with underscores.

### Minimum contrast ratio

Applications working with colors in the terminal can be tricky, they can use the following colors for text:

- The default foreground color
- A palette of 16 colors as defined by the terminal theme
- A set of 240 fixed colors
- Any rgb color (16 million)

The problem is the application doesn't know what the default background color or foreground color is and whether it will have good contrast or not and sometimes they draw colors that users have issues with.

To solve this problem the terminal can now change the foreground color of text dynamically to meet a certain contrast ratio. Just set the color to the desired contrast ratio ranging from 1 to 21:

```json
// 4.5 is recommended for baseline website accessibility
"terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio": 4.5
```

Then the colors will increase or decrease luminance until either the contrast ratio is met or the foreground becomes `#000000` or `#ffffff`.

Theme: Sapphire, Font: Hack

## Browser support

### Improved support for Firefox and Safari (macOS & iPadOS)

During this milestone, we focused on improving the experience of VS Code running in a browser when using Firefox or Safari. We fixed many issues to support both browsers ([Firefox](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Afirefox+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22), [Safari](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asafari+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22)).

TODO@Pung mention iPadOS improvements.

### More features in `yarn web` setup

Last milestone, we [introduced support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_40#_test-vs-code-running-in-a-browser) for running `yarn web` from our repository to setup VS Code running in the browser. This setup is still meant to be used for testing issues in browsers and not for development.

This milestone we added more features that can be tested:

* Debug
* Search
* Tasks
* Problems

Here is a video showing the new features in action:

## Extension authoring

### Strict getWordRangeAtPosition

The [`TextDocument.getWordRangeAtPosition`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/58479e80ab899402283b522da173c34867d7c78f/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L224) API is now more strict and instead of ignoring invalid regular expressions which result in empty string matches, it will throw an error.

## Engineering

### Insiders available in the yum repository

The insiders build is now available in the yum repository and is automatically published just like with the apt repository. Follow the [instructions on the website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_rhel-fedora-and-centos-based-distributions) to set up the repo and install `code-insiders`.

## Notable fixes
