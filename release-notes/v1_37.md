## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.37 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[July iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/76735)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/97?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Render whitespace in selection

The `editor.renderWhitespace` setting now supports a `selection` option. With this, whitespace will be shown only on selected text:

### Settings editor support for array-of-string settings

The Settings editor now allows editing array-of-string settings:

![Settings UI for array-of-string settings](images/1_37/settings-ui-array-of-string.png)

Extension authors can enable this support by [contributing a configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.configuration) with `type` and `items` keys:

```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "string"
  }
}
```

### Removed warnings from Settings files

Settings files will not show warnings for unknown or unsupported settings now. Warnings are also not shown when you have configured settings from extensions which are disabled. Instead these are shown as unused code.

### Improved minimap search decoration visibility

In the previous release, we introduced search decorations in the minimap. These decorations were difficult to see, so this iteration, we've worked on increasing their visibility. Now, the entire line will now be highlighted with low opacity in the minimap, and the actual match shown with high opacity.

You can also change the color of the decorations using the new `minimap.findMatchHighlight` theme color.

### `focusedView` context key

Introduced a new context key `focusedView` which can be used to define keybinding when a given view is focused

`"when": "focusedView == nodeDependencies"`

## Languages

### Improved navigation for SCSS @import

VS Code used to resolve SCSS imports statically. For example, `@import './foo'` would resolve to `_foo.scss`. However, SCSS is more flexible in the way it resolves imports, allowing `./foo` to resolve to one of the five locations:

* `a.scss`
* `_a.scss`
* `a/index.scss`
* `a/_index.scss`
* `a.css`

VS Code now resolves `@import './foo'` to one of these locations if the resolved file exists on disk. Note that if a link ends with `/`, it will only resolve to either `/index.scss` or `/_index.scss`. If a link ends with suffix such as `.css` or `.scss`, VS Code will not try the alternative file locations.

## Extension authoring

### vscode.workspace.fs

There is new API that allows to read, write, and manage files and folders. This is an alternative to Node.js's [fs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/fs.html)-module and more important it allows to access files from contributed file systems, like the ssh or wsl remote file systems.

The snippet below shows how to write to a file, more usage samples can be found here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/0b3a31bf2bdd388ac4fdc0ccea2fb1315abfe3e3/fsconsumer-sample.

```ts
const writeStr = '1€ is 1.12$ is 0.9£';
const writeBytes = Buffer.from(writeStr, 'utf8');

await vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile(someUri, writeBytes);
```

### DiagnosticsTag.Deprecated

Diagnostic tags enable extensions authors to enrich the representation of diagnostics inside the editor. This release adds `DiagnosticTag.Deprecated` and the editor will render such diagnostics with a strike through line.

### vscode.workspace.workspaceFile moved to API

There is a new workspace property `workspace.workspaceFile` returning the location of the workspace file. For example: `file:///Users/name/Development/myProject.code-workspace` or `untitled:1555503116870` for a workspace that is untitled and not yet saved.

Depending on the workspace that is opened, the value will be:

* `undefined` when no workspace or a single folder is opened.
* The path of the workspace file as `Uri`.

If the workspace is untitled, the returned URI will use the `untitled:` scheme.

One use of the workspace file location is to call the `vscode.openFolder` command to open the workspace again after it has been closed:

```typescript
  vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.openFolder', uriOfWorkspace);
```

**Note:** It is not recommended using the `workspace.workspaceFile` location to write configuration data directly into the file. You can use `workspace.getConfiguration().update()` which will work both when a single folder is opened as well as an untitled or saved workspace.

## Proposed extension APIs

### vscode.commands.onDidExecuteCommand

There is a new event that fires whenever an event has been executed - its payload identifies the command and arguments.

```ts
export interface CommandExecutionEvent {
  command: string;
  arguments: any[];
}
export namespace commands {
  /**
   * An event that is emitted when a [command](#Command) is executed.
   */
  export const onDidExecuteCommand: Event<CommandExecutionEvent>;
}
```

## Notable fixes

* [422](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/422): Preserve window size when restoring a maximized window
* [77926](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77926): Typing "string;" sometimes inserts "strings;"
* [76922](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/76922): Ordering of Side bar views is persisted across all windows
