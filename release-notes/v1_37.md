## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.37 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[July iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/76735)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/97?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### New product icons

![vs code product icons](images/1_37/icons.gif)

We've updated all of our product icons to be uniform in style, color, and size. We went through [various iterations](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/8017) and the community was helpful in providing feedback through every step of the process.

Note: This does not cover our use of Octicons, those icons appear in the Status bar and Quick pick.

### Render whitespace in selection

The `editor.renderWhitespace` setting now supports a `selection` option. With this option set, whitespace will be shown only on selected text:

![Whitespace rendered on selection](images/1_37/render-whitespace-on-selection.png)

This is handy for quickly checking whitespace without filling the entire editor.

### Settings editor support for array-of-string settings

The Settings editor now allows editing array-of-string settings. The **Add Item** button will bring up a input box to add a new string.

![Settings UI for array-of-string settings](images/1_37/settings-ui-array-of-string.png)

Extension authors can enable this support by [contributing a configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.configuration) with `type` and `items` keys:

```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "string"
  }
}
```

### Removed warnings from settings files

You will no longer see warnings for unknown or unsupported settings in your `settings.json` files. Instead inactive settings will be faded, similar to unused source code, with a hover explaining why. In addition, you won't see warnings for settings from extensions that are disabled.

![Unused Settings](images/1_37/unused-settings.png)

### Improved minimap search results visibility

In the previous release, we introduced search decorations in the minimap. These decorations were difficult to see, so this iteration, we've worked on increasing their visibility. Now, the entire line will now be highlighted with low opacity in the minimap, and the actual match shown with high opacity.

![Minimap search decorations](images/1_37/minimap-search-decorations.png)

You can also change the color of the decorations using the new `minimap.findMatchHighlight` theme color.

![Minimap search decorations](images/1_37/minimap-search-decorations.png)

You can also change the color of the decorations using the new `minimap.findMatchHighlight` theme color.

### Improved discoverability of the NPM Scripts Explorer

Previously, you had to enable the setting `npm.enableScriptExplorer` to make the NPM Scripts Explorer visible. This was difficult to discover. Now, the NPM Scripts explorer is shown collapsed, when there is a `package.json` file at the root of the workspace. If you want to hide the explorer, you can simply right click on its title and select 'Hide' from the context menu.

### focusedView context key

There is a new keybinding `when` context key `focusedView` to display or enable a keybinding when a given view is focused.

```json
"when": "focusedView == nodeDependencies"
```

### Accessibility improvements

We fixed accessibility issues across the workbench. A full list of issues fixed can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=milestone%3A%22July+2019%22+label%3Aaccessibility+is%3Aclosed).

## Languages

### Improved navigation for SCSS @import

VS Code used to resolve SCSS imports statically. For example, `@import './foo'` would resolve to `_foo.scss`. However, SCSS is more flexible in the way it resolves imports, allowing `./foo` to resolve to one of the five locations:

* `a.scss`
* `_a.scss`
* `a/index.scss`
* `a/_index.scss`
* `a.css`

VS Code now resolves `@import './foo'` to one of these locations if the resolved file exists on disk. Note that if a link ends with `/`, it will only resolve to either `/index.scss` or `/_index.scss`. If a link ends with suffix such as `.css` or `.scss`, VS Code will not try the alternative file locations.

## Contributions to extensions

### Remote Development (Preview)

Work has continued on the [Remote Development](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension) extensions, which allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment. You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/master/remote-release-notes/v1_37.md).

You can also read two recent blog posts describing [Linux development with WSL and Visual Studio Code](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/an-in-depth-tutorial-on-linux-development-on-windows-with-wsl-and-visual-studio-code) and [Remote development over SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/07/25/remote-ssh).

## Extension authoring

### vscode.workspace.fs

There is new API for extensions to read, write, and manage files and folders. This is an alternative to Node.js's [fs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/fs.html) file system module and more importantly, it allows access to files from contributed file systems, such as the SSH or WSL remote file systems.

The snippet below shows how to write to a file, more usage samples can be found in the [fsconsumer-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/0b3a31bf2bdd388ac4fdc0ccea2fb1315abfe3e3/fsconsumer-sample).

```ts
const writeStr = '1€ is 1.12$ is 0.9£';
const writeBytes = Buffer.from(writeStr, 'utf8');

await vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile(someUri, writeBytes);
```

### DiagnosticsTag.Deprecated

Diagnostic tags enable extension authors to enrich the representation of diagnostics inside the editor. This release adds `DiagnosticTag.Deprecated`, which the editor will render with a strike-through line.

![Strikeout decoration](images/1_37/diag-tag-deprecated.png)

### vscode.workspace.workspaceFile

There is a new workspace property `workspace.workspaceFile` returning the location of the workspace file. For example: `file:///Users/name/Development/myProject.code-workspace` or `untitled:1555503116870` for a workspace that is untitled and not yet saved.

Depending on the workspace that is opened, the value will be:

* `undefined` when no workspace or a single folder is opened.
* The path of the workspace file as `Uri`.

If the workspace is untitled, the returned URI will use the `untitled:` scheme.

One use of the workspace file location is to call the `vscode.openFolder` command to open the workspace again after it has been closed:

```typescript
  vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.openFolder', uriOfWorkspace);
```

**Note:** It is not recommended using the `workspace.workspaceFile` location to write configuration data directly into the file. Instead use the `workspace.getConfiguration().update()` method, which will work both when a single folder is opened as well as an untitled or saved workspace.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### vscode.commands.onDidExecuteCommand

There is a new event that fires whenever a command has been executed and the event's payload identifies the command and arguments.

```ts
export interface CommandExecutionEvent {
  command: string;
  arguments: any[];
}
export namespace commands {
  /**
   * An event that is emitted when a [command](#Command) is executed.
   */
  export const onDidExecuteCommand: Event<CommandExecutionEvent>;
}
```

## New documentation

## Remote Development tutorials

There are new step-by-step tutorials to walk you through running Visual Studio Code with the Remote Development extensions.

* [Remote via SSH](/remote-tutorials/ssh/getting-started) - Connect to remote and virtual machines with Visual Studio Code via SSH.
* [Working in WSL](/remote-tutorials/wsl/getting-started) - Run Visual Studio Code in Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Notable fixes
