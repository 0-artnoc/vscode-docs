## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.33 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/70102)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/88?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Proposed extension APIs

### Custom Task Execution

In addition to ProcessExecution and ShellExecution tasks there is now a CustomExecution task. Instead of launching a process or running a script, it executes a callback provided by the extension.
````typescript
let execution = new vscode.CustomExecution((terminalRenderer, cancellationToken, args): Thenable<number> => {
		return new Promise<number>(resolve => {
			// This is the custom task callback!
			resolve(0);
		});
	});
	const taskName = "First custom task";
	let task = new vscode.Task2(kind, vscode.TaskScope.Workspace, taskName, taskType, execution);
````
This will give an extension provided task more flexibility for maintaining state when the task is run. It also provides access to the input and output for a task. For a complete example, see the [test item]( https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/71089).
