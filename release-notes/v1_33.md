## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.33 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/70102)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/88?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Improved Source Control View

The Source Control view has been aligned to behave like other views, such as the Explorer, Debug, etc. Repositories can now be made visible or hidden using context menus actions. Their order and sizing is now preserved. You can show and hide the `Source Control Providers` view also with context menu actions. That view also behaves like the `Open Editors` view and resizes itself up to a certain number of source control providers. If you'd like to disable the automatic resizing and prefer to resize it manually, set the newly introduced `scm.providers.visible` setting to `0`.

### List simple keyboard navigation when screen reader detected

When VS Code detects that a screen reader is being used we automatically turn on simple keyboard navigation for lists. This makes the list keyboard navigation easier for users that use a screen reader since each key stroke will navigate to the corresponding item. This applies for all lists and trees in the workbench, for example: explorer, open editors, debug views and so on...

## Debugging

### Support for sub-sessions

In this milestone we have added support to optionally display debug sessions as a tree in the debugger UI. Previously debug session were displayed as flat lists.

This functionality is only available through the extension API as an additional "parent" parameter to the `vscode.debug.startDebugging()` API.

Currently this feature is adopted in two places by extensions:
* In node.js cluster debugging all subprocesses of the cluster are registered under the main debug session.
* In the "server-ready feature" an automatically launched Chrome browser session is registered as a child of the server debug session

## Extensions

### Installing Missing Dependencies

Improved the extension activation failure notification when it has a missing dependency by providing an action to install the missing dependency.

You can also install all missing dependencies using the newly introduced command **Extensions: Install Missing Dependencies**

## Extension Authoring

### Install Extension Command

A new command `workbench.extensions.installExtension` is introduced to install an extension from Marketplace or a VSIX.
- To install an extension from Marketplace provide its identifier. `vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.extensions.installExtension', 'ms-python.python');`
- To install a VSIX provide its location URI. `vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.extensions.installExtension', vscode.Uri.file('path-to-vsix'));`

### Debug toolbar contributed commands positioning

Now it is possible to position the contributed debug commands in any order in the debug toolbar. Simply use the group `navigation` and an order if you would like your contributed commands to be mixed with the default ones.

In addition we are deprecating the menu id `debug/toolbar` in favor of `debug/toolBar`. In the March release we will support both menu ids, however in April `debug/toolbar` menu id will no longer be supported.

### sidebarVisible context is deprecated in favor of sideBarVisible

We are deprecating the context `sidebarVisible` in favor of `sideBarVisible`. In the March release both contexts will be supported, however in the April release we will no longer support `sidebarVisible`.

## Proposed extension APIs

### Custom Task Execution

In addition to ProcessExecution and ShellExecution tasks there is now a CustomExecution task. Instead of launching a process or running a script, it executes a callback provided by the extension.
````typescript
let execution = new vscode.CustomExecution((terminalRenderer, cancellationToken, args): Thenable<number> => {
		return new Promise<number>(resolve => {
			// This is the custom task callback!
			resolve(0);
		});
	});
	const taskName = "First custom task";
	let task = new vscode.Task2(kind, vscode.TaskScope.Workspace, taskName, taskType, execution);
````
This will give an extension provided task more flexibility for maintaining state when the task is run. It also provides access to the input and output for a task. For a complete example, see the [test item]( https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/71089).

## Engineering

### Caching NPM Packages

Thanks to our friends over at Microsoft DevLabs, we were able to speed up our [OSS builds](https://dev.azure.com/vscode/VSCode/_build?definitionId=12), using an [Azure Pipelines extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching) which caches NPM packages and speeds up the whole `npm install` process. If you'd like to know more about this, go ahead and read up [](https://medium.com/microsoft-1es/reducing-vs-code-ci-build-times-e0c5872bfdde) by [Ethan Dennis](https://github.com/erdennis13).
