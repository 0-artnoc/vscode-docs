## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.33 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/70102)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/88?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Improved Source Control view

The Source Control view has been aligned to behave like other views, such as the File Explorer, Debug, etc. Repositories can now be made visible or hidden using context menu actions. Their order and sizing is now preserved. You can show and hide the **Source Control Providers** view also with context menu actions. That view also behaves like the **Open Editors** view and resizes itself up to a certain number of source control providers. If you'd like to disable the automatic resizing and prefer to resize it manually, set the newly introduced `scm.providers.visible` setting to `0`.

### List simple keyboard navigation when screen reader detected

When VS Code detects that a screen reader is being used, we automatically turn on simple keyboard navigation for lists. This makes the list keyboard navigation easier for users with a screen reader since each key stroke will navigate to the corresponding item. This applies for all lists and trees in the workbench, for example the File Explorer, Open Editors, and Debug views.

## Integrated Terminal

### ConPTY turned on by default on Windows build 18309+

For supporting versions of Windows 10 Insiders, the new terminal back-end ConPTY will be turned on by default. This should result in a more stable experience closer to the native terminal and added 256 color support. If you experience issues, please let [us](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) or the [Console team](https://github.com/Microsoft/console/issues) know. You can always opt out with this setting:

```json
{
    "terminal.integrated.windowsEnableConpty": false
}
```

### Data parsing capped to 12 ms

Previously the amount of data parsed by the terminal was not being capped properly. This meant that on less powerful hardware, the amount of time parsing data and rendering would far exceed the ideal time to render a frame, resulting in laggy UI or a full lock up for commands that generated a lot of output. There is now a cap in place, which prevents this from exceeding approximately 12 ms, which should avoid these issues.

## Debugging

### Support for sub-sessions

In this milestone, we have added support to display debug sessions as a tree in the debugger UI. Previously debug session were displayed as a flat list, which made it difficult to grasp that sessions were related.

Since this functionality is available via a new extension API, it requires adoption by debugger extensions. In this milestone, the only debugger that makes use of hierarchical debug sessions is VS Code's Node.js debugger.

In Node.js cluster debugging, all subprocesses of a cluster are registered under the main debug session:

![Hover](images/1_33/sub-sessions.png)

In the "server-ready feature" (see below), an automatically launched Chrome browser session is registered as a child of the server debug session.

### Automatically open a URI when debugging a server program

The last milestone had a [preview version of the "server ready" feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_32#_automatically-open-a-uri-when-debugging-a-server-program), which allows you to open a URL in a web browser automatically as soon as a specific program output message is detected. This feature is useful for debugging web server source code because the URL opened in the browser can make the server hit a breakpoint as soon as the server is ready (and this all with a single `F5` key press).

In this milestone, we've moved the feature out of preview. VS Code looks for the trigger message not only in the Debug Console but also in the Integrated Terminal. In addition, we've also improved the error handling.

Note that for technical reasons, it is impossible to support the "server ready" feature in external terminals.

## Extensions

### Installing missing dependencies

We've improved the extension activation failure notification when VS Code detects a missing dependency and now provide an action to install the missing dependency.

![Hover](images/1_33/extension-dep-install.png)

You can also install all missing dependencies using the new **Extensions: Install Missing Dependencies** command.

## Extension authoring

### Install extension command

A new command `workbench.extensions.installExtension` was introduced to install an extension from the Marketplace or a VSIX.

* To install an extension from the Marketplace, you provide its identifier. `vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.extensions.installExtension', 'ms-python.python');`
* To install via a VSIX, you provide its location URI. `vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.extensions.installExtension', vscode.Uri.file('path-to-vsix'));`

### Debug toolbar contributed commands positioning

It is now possible to position the contributed debug commands in any order in the Debug toolbar. Use the group `navigation` and an order, if you would like your contributed commands to be mixed with the default ones.

In addition, we are deprecating the menu ID `debug/toolbar` in favor of `debug/toolBar`. In the March release, we will support both menu IDs, however in April `debug/toolbar` menu ID will no longer be supported.

### sidebarVisible context is deprecated in favor of sideBarVisible

We are deprecating the context `sidebarVisible` in favor of `sideBarVisible`. In the March release, both contexts will be supported, however in the April release we will no longer support `sidebarVisible`.

### TerminalOptions.shellArgs now accepts strings on Windows

Previously `TerminalOptions.shellArgs` only supported a list of arguments in the form `string[]`. This could cause issues on Windows as the string array needs to be converted into the [command line format](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/08dfcab2-eb6e-49a4-80eb-87d4076c98c6) and the conversion could go wrong or be hard to get right for complicated cases. You can now bypass this conversion process on Windows by using a `string` in command-line format directly.

### Hierarchical debug sessions

In order to support hierarchical debug sessions, we've added an optional argument `parentSession` to the `vsode.debug.startDebugging` API. If specified, VS Code shows the debug session resulting from `startDebugging` in a tree-like way as a child of the parent session.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Custom task execution

In addition to `ProcessExecution` and `ShellExecution` tasks, there is now a `CustomExecution` task. Instead of launching a process or running a script, it executes a callback provided by the extension.

````typescript
let execution = new vscode.CustomExecution((terminalRenderer, cancellationToken, args): Thenable<number> => {
        return new Promise<number>(resolve => {
            // This is the custom task callback!
            resolve(0);
        });
    });
    const taskName = "First custom task";
    let task = new vscode.Task2(kind, vscode.TaskScope.Workspace, taskName, taskType, execution);
````

This will give an extension provided task more flexibility for maintaining state when the task is run. It also provides access to the input and output for a task. For a complete example, see the [test item](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/71089).

### Commenting API

We did large refactoring around Commenting related features for the last two months, based on the lessons and experience we learned from [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension and feedback from the community. The newly designed Commenting API is generic and powerful enough for different types of usage. [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension already moved to the new Commenting API.

All VS Code Insiders will get this new interface and we will use the April milestone to tune and tweak the API. The old Commenting API will also be removed in April. You can play with the [sample extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/pull/160) to get a better understanding of the API or take a deep look at [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github).

## Engineering

### Caching NPM packages

Thanks to our friends over at Microsoft DevLabs, we were able to speed up our [OSS builds](https://dev.azure.com/vscode/VSCode/_build?definitionId=12), using an [Azure Pipelines extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching) which caches NPM packages and speeds up the whole `npm install` process. If you'd like to know more about this, you can read this [blog post](https://medium.com/microsoft-1es/reducing-vs-code-ci-build-times-e0c5872bfdde) by [Ethan Dennis](https://github.com/erdennis13).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Pull Requests

This milestone we continued working on improvements to the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension.

Below are some of the new features:

* Polished rendering of GitHub todo list in description page.
* We adopted the new [Commenting API](#commenting-api)

## Notable fixes

* [66632](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/66632): Terminal link underlines on lines that start with \t are offset
* [70962](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/70962): Console.WriteLine() does not result in an empty line anymore
