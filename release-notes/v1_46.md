# May 2020 (version 1.46)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.46 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/97432)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Pin Tabs

You can now pin tabs either from the context menu or using the new command `workbench.action.pinEditor` (`kb(workbench.action.pinEditor)`).

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

 Pinned tabs have a number of useful features to help mark files that are important to you:
 * they always appear first before non-pinned tabs
 * they will not scroll out of view if you have many tabs opened
 * they will not close from operations such as "Close Others"
 * they will not close if you have a limit of opened editors configured that is reached

 You can drag and drop tabs in and out to change the pinned state too.

 Pinned tabs visually shrink to the size of an icon (or will show the first letter of the filename if icons are disabled) to save space. If you want to see the dirty indicator with pinned tabs, consider to configure `workbench.editor.highlightModifiedTabs: true`.

 **Note:** we are still thinking about other ways of how to present pinned tabs. If you have an opinion, feel free to throw your ideas into the existing issues for [showing a secondary tab bar](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/98160) or having a setting to [show more context for pinned tabs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/98161).

## Browser support

### Debug Breakpoint Indicator in Title

TBD

### More support for running Code from the integrated terminal

Did you know? When you open an integrated terminal in VSCode for web, you can type `code` to get access to a few useful commands that will all work in the browser!

![Terminal Remote](images/1_46/terminal-web.png)

In this iteration we expanded the support for many of the options to work properly:
* `--goto` to open a file on a specific line
* `--diff` to compare two files
* `--wait` to let a program wait for files closing
* `--add` to add a folder to the current workspace

### Better file/folder upload

We always allowed you to drop files into the files explorer to upload them. In this iteration we improved this to allow you to drop folders to upload them including all child folders and files. Since this can be a long running operation, you will see progress reported in the status bar and can even cancel the operation as needed.

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command ID
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.pinEditor)`|Pin Editor|`workbench.action.pinEditor`
`kb(workbench.action.unpinEditor)`|Unpin Editor|`workbench.action.unpinEditor`

## Engineering

### New `--crash-reporter-directory` argument for diagnosing issues

A new command line argument `--crash-reporter-directory` allows to pass a local folder where crash reports should be persisted to. This even works for crashes in the extension host and should be used whenever VSCode is crashing and you want to report an issue about it.

### Preload Scripts

We have added Electron `preload` scripts to VSCode for exposing certain Electron APIs to the window. This is one of the first steps towards a fully sandboxed window. Progress is outlined at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92164.

## Notable fixes

* [95856](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/95856): Go To Line should include "filename.exenstion:line number" format
* [63068](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/63068): macOS dock icon is miniscule
* [10144](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/10144): Use system-ui as font on Linux

Contributions to `localization`:

We have keenly listened to your feedback over the past year, and decided it was time to provide a more reliable and interactive platform where you can continue contributing to the official VS Code development through localization. With this in mind, we officially decommissioned the Microsoft Localization Community Platform (MLCP) in the first week of April with the intent of continuing the Microsoft Community Localization Program through an alternative community platform for open source SW localization projects. Please stay tuned in the upcoming weeks for an announcement on our [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/wiki) page about the new community platform. Please also visit the [FAQs](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/wiki/FAQ) page for answers to frequently asked questions about this platform transition.
