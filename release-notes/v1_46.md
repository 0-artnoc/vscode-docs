# May 2020 (version 1.46)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.46 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/97432)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

This milestone we again received great feedback from our community, which helped us identify and tackle many [accessibility issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22May+2020%22+is%3Aclosed).

* The Status bar now supports keyboard navigation. When focus is in the Status bar via **Focus Next Part** (`kb(workbench.action.focusNextPart)`), arrow navigation moves between Status bar entries.
* To make it easier to start and end selection using the keyboard, there are four new commands:
  * **Set Selection Anchor** (`kb(editor.action.setSelectionAnchor)`)
  * **Select From Anchor to Cursor** (`kb(editor.action.selectFromAnchorToCursor)`)
  * **Cancel Selection Anchor** (`kb(editor.action.cancelSelectionAnchor)`)
  * **Go to Selection Anchor**
* Activity bar entries now have a `tab` role and set the appropriate `aria-expanded` state.
* Aria labels of editors now properly convey the following editor states: `pinned`, `preview`, and `readonly`.

## Workbench

### Pin Tabs

You can now pin tabs either from the context menu or using the new command `workbench.action.pinEditor` (`kb(workbench.action.pinEditor)`).

![Pin Tabs](images/1_46/pin-tabs.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

 Pinned tabs have a number of useful features to help mark files that are important to you:

* Pinned tabs always appear first before non-pinned tabs.
* They do not scroll out of view if you have many tabs opened.
* They do not close when using commands such as **Close Others**.
* They do not close even if you exceed a set limit on the number of opened editors.

 You can also drag and drop tabs in and out to change the pinned state.

 Pinned tabs visually shrink to the size of an icon (or will show the first letter of the filename if icons are disabled) to save space. If you want to see the dirty indicator with pinned tabs, you can set `workbench.editor.highlightModifiedTabs: true`.

 **Note:** We are still thinking about other ways to present pinned tabs. If you have an opinion, feel free to share your ideas in the existing issues for [showing a secondary tab bar](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/98160) or having a setting to [show more context for pinned tabs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/98161).

### Explorer auto reveal focus without forcing a scroll

There is a new option `focusNoScroll` for the `explorer.autoReveal` setting. When using this option, the Explorer will automatically select files when opening them but will not scroll to reveal them in the Explorer view.

## Debugging

### Automatic debug configurations improvements

This milestone we have improved the experience for automatic debug configurations:

* It is now possible to save an automatically detected debug configuration by clicking on the **Configure Debug Configuration in launch.json** button in the Quick Pick dropdown.
* The Debug dropdown now remembers the previously chosen automatic debug configuration.
* It is now possible to show all automatic debug configurations from the Run and Debug start view.

  ![Automatic debug configs in start view](images/1_46/automatic-debug-configs.png)

### Step Into Targets

The VS Code debugging UI shows the **Step Into Targets** action in the context menu when a debug session is stopped, if a debug extension supports this capability. After this command is executed, a user can choose from a list of targets to step into.

For now, only the Mock Debug extension implements **Step Into Target** support, but soon other debug extensions will follow - such as the Julia language debugger.

## Browser support

### Debug breakpoint indicator in tab title

Once a breakpoint is hit and the VS Code tab is not focused, we update the tab title to include a red circle indicator ðŸ”´. This should make it easier for users to discover that a breakpoint is hit in one of the inactive tabs where VS Code is running. As soon as the tab is focused, we no longer show the breakpoint indicator.

### Running VS Code from the Integrated Terminal

Did you know that when you open an Integrated Terminal in VS Code running in the browser, you can type `code` to get access to several useful commands that all work in the browser!

![Terminal Remote](images/1_46/terminal-web.png)

In this iteration, we expanded support for many options:

* `--goto` to open a file on a specific line
* `--diff` to compare two files
* `--wait` to let a program wait for files closing
* `--add` to add a folder to the current workspace

In [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces/), for example, this enables you to use the browser-based VS Code as an editor for Git:

![VS Code Git Editor](images/1_46/code-git-editor.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

### Better file/folder upload

VS Code lets you drop files into the File Explorer to upload them. In this iteration, we improved this feature to allow you to drop folders to upload them, including all child folders and files. Since this can be a long running operation, you will see progress reported in the Status bar and you can cancel the operation if needed.

![Web Upload](images/1_46/web-upload.gif)

## Preview features

### TS 4.0 support

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

* `debugConsole.warningForeground`: Foreground color for warning messages in debug console
* `debugConsole.errorForeground`: Foreground color for error messages in debug console
* `debugConsole.sourceForeground`: Foreground color for source filenames in debug console

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### AccessibilityInformation

We have added `AccessibilityInformation` to the `TreeItem`, `StatusBarItem`, and `TimelineItem` elements to better support screen readers. `AccessibilityInformation` contains a `label` and a `role`. The `label` is read by screen readers and the `role` describes the accessibility characteristics of the element.

## Engineering

### --crash-reporter-directory argument for diagnosing issues

A new command-line argument `--crash-reporter-directory` allows you to pass a local folder where you'd like to save crash reports. This even works for crashes in the extension host and can be used whenever VS Code is crashing and you want to report an issue.

### Preload Scripts

We have added Electron `preload` scripts to VS Code for exposing certain Electron APIs to the window. This is one of the first steps towards a fully sandboxed window. Progress is outlined in [issue #92164](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92164).

### Extension samples now use ESLint

Contributions to `localization`:

We have keenly listened to your feedback over the past year, and decided it was time to provide a more reliable and interactive platform, where you can contribute to VS Code localization development. With this in mind, we officially decommissioned the Microsoft Localization Community Platform (MLCP) in the first week of April, with the intent of continuing the Microsoft Community Localization Program on an alternative platform for open-source localization projects.

Stay tuned in the upcoming weeks for an announcement on our [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/wiki) page about the new community platform. You can also visit the [FAQ](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/wiki/FAQ) page for answers about this platform transition.
