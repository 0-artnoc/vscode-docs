Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.46 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

## Engineering

### New `--crash-reporter-directory` argument for diagnosing issues

A new command line argument `--crash-reporter-directory` allows to pass a local folder where crash reports should be persisted to. This even works for crashes in the extension host and should be used whenever VSCode is crashing and you want to report an issue about it.

### Preload Scripts

We have added Electron `preload` scripts to VSCode for exposing certain Electron APIs to the window. This is one of the first steps towards a fully sandboxed window. Progress is outlined at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92164.

## Notable fixes

* [95856](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/95856): Go To Line should include "filename.exenstion:line number" format
* [63068](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/63068): macOS dock icon is miniscule
* [10144](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/10144): Use system-ui as font on Linux
