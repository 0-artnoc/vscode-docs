Contributions to `localization`:

We have keenly listened to your feedback over the past year, and decided it was time to provide a more reliable and interactive platform where you can continue contributing to the official VS Code development through localization. With this in mind, we officially decommissioned the Microsoft Localization Community Platform (MLCP) in the first week of April with the intent of continuing the Microsoft Community Localization Program through an alternative community platform for open source SW localization projects. Please stay tuned in the upcoming weeks for an announcement on our [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/wiki) page about the new community platform. Please also visit the [FAQs](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/wiki/FAQ) page for answers to frequently asked questions about this platform transition.
