# May 2020 (version 1.46)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.46 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/97432)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

This milestone we again received great feedback from our community, which helped us identify and tackle many [accessibility issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22May+2020%22+is%3Aclosed).

* The Status bar now supports keyboard navigation. When focus is in the Status bar via **Focus Next Part** (`kb(workbench.action.focusNextPart)`), arrow navigation moves between Status bar entries.
* To make it easier to start and end selection using the keyboard, there are four new commands:
  * **Set Selection Anchor** (`kb(editor.action.setSelectionAnchor)`)
  * **Select From Anchor to Cursor** (`kb(editor.action.selectFromAnchorToCursor)`)
  * **Cancel Selection Anchor** (`kb(editor.action.cancelSelectionAnchor)`)
  * **Go to Selection Anchor**
* Activity bar entries now have a `tab` role and set the appropriate `aria-expanded` state.
* Aria labels of editors now properly convey the following editor states: `pinned`, `preview`, and `readonly`.

## Workbench

### Pin tabs

You can now pin tabs either from the context menu or using the new command `workbench.action.pinEditor` (`kb(workbench.action.pinEditor)`).

![Pin Tabs](images/1_46/pin-tabs.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

 Pinned tabs have a number of useful features to help mark files that are important to you:

* Pinned tabs always appear first before non-pinned tabs.
* They do not scroll out of view if you have many tabs opened.
* They do not close when using commands such as **Close Others**.
* They do not close even if you exceed a set limit on the number of opened editors.

 You can also drag and drop tabs in and out to change the pinned state.

 Pinned tabs visually shrink to the size of an icon (or will show the first letter of the filename if icons are disabled) to save space. If you want to see the dirty indicator with pinned tabs, you can set `workbench.editor.highlightModifiedTabs: true`.

 **Note:** We are still thinking about other ways to present pinned tabs. If you have an opinion, feel free to share your ideas in the existing issues for [showing a secondary tab bar](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/98160) or having a setting to [show more context for pinned tabs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/98161).

### Explorer auto reveal focus without forcing a scroll

There is a new option `focusNoScroll` for the `explorer.autoReveal` setting. When using this option, the Explorer will automatically select files when opening them but will not scroll to reveal them in the Explorer view.

### Smooth scrolling for lists and trees

Enabling the `workbench.list.smoothScrolling` setting will make scrolling in lists and trees much smoother with hardware that lacks smooth scrolling (for example, discrete mouse wheel on Windows).

![Smooth scrolling](images/1_46/smooth-scrolling.gif)

### Sash size configuration

You can now use the `workbench.sash.size` setting to configure the feedback area size in pixels of the dragging area in between views/editors. Set it to a larger value if you feel it's hard to resize views using the mouse.

### Screencast mode font size

The new `screencastMode.fontSize` setting lets you configure the font size in pixels that is being used in screencast mode.

## Integrated Terminal

### Improved link support

The Integrated Terminal link preview from last month has replaced the old implementation. The new links implementation now enables:

* Better web and `file://` link detection, by using the editor's link detection.
* Folder link support, either opening the folder in the Explorer or opening a new VS Code window.
* Different link actions for different link types, falling back to "word" links that search the workspace (based on the `terminal.integrated.wordSeparators` setting).
* Similar link highlighting and hover experience to the editor.

![Terminal with various links](images/1_45/terminal-links.gif)

*Theme: [Topaz (Dim)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-topaz)*

## Source Control

### Open in Terminal

You can now open a repository in a Terminal, from the context menu in the Source Control Providers view.

![Open In Terminal](images/1_46/scm-open-in-terminal.png)

### Add remote from GitHub

You can now easily add a GitHub repository as a remote to your local repositories using the **Git: Add Remote...** command.

![Add Remote](images/1_46/git-add-remote.gif)

### Publish to GitHub: Generate .gitignore

It's now possible to generate a `.gitignore` file when publishing a workspace to GitHub. When publishing a workspace to GitHub, you are prompted to select which files to include in the repository.

![Publish to GitHub](images/1_46/publish-to-github.png)

### Input field font family

You can now customize the font family that is being used in the SCM input field using the **Scm: Input Font Family** setting. The setting supports the following values:

* `default` - Workbench user interface font family.
* `editor` - Font family specified in the **Editor: Font Family** setting.
* `font family name` - The name of the font family to be used in the input field (for example, `Cascadia Code`).

### Abort in progress rebase

You can now abort in progress rebase operations using the **Git: Abort Rebase** command.

## Debugging

### Automatic debug configurations improvements

This milestone we have improved the experience for automatic debug configurations:

* Last milestone, we introduced a feature so that extension authors can analyze the current project and offer debug configurations automatically. These debug configurations are dynamically created and so they do not show up in the `launch.json` configuration file. This is nice as long as they work out of the box, but sometimes you may need to modify the configuration, for instance to add an additional argument. There is now an option to save an automatic debug configuration into a `launch.json`, in order to open it up for editing. To do this, use the gear button at the end of the automatic debug configuration in the **Debug: Select and Start Debugging** Quick Pick:

  ![Edit automatic debug configs](images/1_46/edit-auto-configs.gif)

* It is now possible to show all automatic debug configurations from the Run and Debug start view.

  ![Automatic debug configs in start view](images/1_46/automatic-debug-configs.png)

* The Debug dropdown now remembers the previously chosen automatic debug configuration.

### Step Into Targets

Debugging into a statement with many nested function calls can be painful because you might have to step through functions you are not really interested in. To improve this scenario, the Debug Adapter Protocol has supported the "Step Into Target" feature that displays UI for directly stepping into the function you are interested in.

In this milestone, VS Code has started to use this feature. When debugging has stopped on a statement, the context menu shows a new action **Step Into Targets**. This action presents a list of all targets (typically functions) that are available at the current stack frame. Selecting one of them will step into that target.

Note that every stack frame can have its own set of targets. So the result of the **Step Into Targets** actions depends on the currently selected frame in the CALL STACK view.

![Step into targets](images/1_46/step-into.png)

For now, only the Mock Debug extension has (fake) **Step Into Target** support, but soon other debug extensions will follow - such as the Julia debugger.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.9

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### CommonJS Auto imports

<!-- TODO: mjbvz
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-9/#cjs-auto-imports
-->

### Refactorings preserve newlines

Refactorings for JavaScript and TypeScript, such as `extract to method` and `move to new file`, now try to better preserve the original formatting of the refactored code. This includes any newlines present in the selection:

<!-- TODO: mjbvz image
-->

### Add all missing imports source action

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### JS/TS Go to Symbol in workspace includes all opened projects

By default, [workspace symbol search](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_open-symbol-by-name) for JavaScript and TypeScript now search all opened jsconfig and tsconfig projects. It previously only included search results from the project the focused file belonged to.

This behavior is controlled by the `typescript.workspaceSymbols.scope` setting and requires TS 3.9+. To revert the to previous behavior and only search the current project, just set `"typescript.workspaceSymbols.scope": "currentProject"`

### Add missing import quick fixes can no be marked preferred

The `adding missing import` quick fix for JavaScript and TypeScript now can be marked as the [preferred](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_keybindings-for-code-actions) fix for an error. This lets you adding the missing import with a single keypress using `kb(editor.action.autoFix)`.

Note that `adding missing import` will only be marked as the preferred fix if there is a single valid import. If there are multiple potential imports in your projects, you still need to use the normal code actions menu to select which import to use. Also, to enable `add missing import` quick fixes in JavaScript, you must [enable type checking](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript#_type-checking-javascript).

### JSON offline mode

A new setting `json.schemaDownload.enable` lets you control whether the JSON extension is allowed to fetch JSON schemas from `http` and `https`.

A warning triangle in the Status bar will appear when the current editor would like to use schemas that cannot be downloaded. Schema-based features like validation, code completion, and hovers will then be limited.

![JSON warning triangle](images/1_46/json-no-schema-download.png)

## Browser support

### Debugging stopped indicator in tab title

When debugging an extension in the browser, the debugged extension shows up in a new browser tab that deactivates (hides) the debugger tab. When the debuggee stops for some reason, for example, hits a breakpoint, we are not able to activate the debugger tab (because browsers don't provide an API for this). This makes it almost impossible to discover that the debugged extension has stopped.

To alleviate this problem, we now update the tab title to include a red circle indicator 🔴 (resembling a breakpoint). As soon as the debugger tab is activated, the red dot is removed.

![debuggee stopped indicator in web](images/1_46/breakpoint.gif)

### Running VS Code from the Integrated Terminal

Did you know that when you open an Integrated Terminal in VS Code running in the browser, you can type `code` to get access to several useful commands that all work in the browser!

![Terminal Remote](images/1_46/terminal-web.png)

In this iteration, we expanded support for many options:

* `--goto` to open a file on a specific line
* `--diff` to compare two files
* `--wait` to let a program wait for files closing
* `--add` to add a folder to the current workspace

In [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces/), for example, this enables you to use the browser-based VS Code as an editor for Git:

![VS Code Git Editor](images/1_46/code-git-editor.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

### Better file/folder upload

VS Code lets you drop files into the File Explorer to upload them. In this iteration, we improved this feature to allow you to drop folders to upload them, including all child folders and files. Since this can be a long running operation, you will see progress reported in the Status bar and you can cancel the operation if needed.

![Web Upload](images/1_46/web-upload.gif)

## Accounts management

In previous releases, we introduced a preview of a new accounts management UI alongside the preview of the Settings Sync feature. Now, this UI will show up by default. Extensions using the new proposed [Authentication Provider API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/88309) can surface requests to sign in here, and you can view your accounts and manage extension access. There are currently a limited number of extensions using this API, we will work on increasing adoption once the API is stable.

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Settings Sync

We have been working the last couple of months to support synchronizing VS Code preferences across machines and this feature is available for preview on the [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) release.

In this milestone, we enhanced support for administering and diagnosing Settings Sync.

**Synced Machines view**

We added the **Synced Machines** view to show the list of machines synchronizing your VS Code preferences. A default name is provided based on the type of VS Code (Insiders or Stable) and platform you are using, but you can always update the name using the edit action available on the machine entry in the view.

![Synced Machines](images/1_46/settings-sync-machines.png)

*Theme: GitHub Sharp with Customizations*

You can open this view using **Preferences Sync: Show Synced Data** command from the Command Palette.

**Synced Data view**

We added following enhancements to the Synced Data view.

* You can now see the machine from which data is being synced.
* You can restore to a specific state using the **restore** action available on the data entry in the view.
* You can reset data on the cloud using the **Reset Synced Data** action available under **More Action** (**...**) button in the view header.

![Synced Data](images/1_46/settings-sync-data.png)

*Theme: GitHub Sharp with Customizations*

We now provide better assistance while turning on sync by checking if you are about to sync with the data from a different machine and allow you in taking an appropriate action.

* **Replace Local** action will replace your data on the current machine with the synced data from the cloud.
* **Merge** action will merge your data on the current machine with the synced data from the cloud.
* **Show Synced Data** action will open Synced Data view to see the synced data from the cloud.

![Merge or Replace](images/1_46/settings-sync-merge.png)

We added protective measures in VS Code to make sure it does not overload the server with too many requests and also improved error handling.

### TS 4.0 support

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Contributions to extensions

### Notebooks

**Quick outline**

Notebook extensions, such as [GitHub Issue Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-github-issue-notebooks), now support quick outline. Press `kb('workbench.action.gotoSymbol')`, or use the **Go to Symbol in Editor** command, and see a preview of all Markdown and code cells of the current notebook.

![Notebook quick outline](images/1_46/notebook-quickouline.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

**Error and symbol navigation**

We have improved how `F8` and **Find All References** work. All code navigation gestures should feel as natural as they to do outside of Notebooks. For instance, the Problems view will now show all errors of all cell grouped by the Notebook, not by cell anymore:

![Problems pane](images/1_46/notebook-problems.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

<!-- TODO: roblou -->

**Join/Split cells**

We introduced two sets of commands for you to quickly join cells or split cells into smaller fragments

![Join/Split cells](images/1_46/notebook-join-split-cells.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

**Retained Notebook**

Pinned or dirty notebook editors are now persistent in the workspace, users won't lose the working status in the notebook no matter the notebook is moved to the background or moved to another editor group.

![retained notebook](images/1_46/retained-notebook-editor.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

**Unified Undo/Redo stack**

Users operations of manipulating Notebook cells or modifying Notebook cell content are now tracked in the same Undo/Redo stack

![Unified undo/redo stack](images/1_46/notebook-unified-undo-redo-stack.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*


## Extension authoring

### Filepath casing

We have fixed a couple of bugs with how VS Code handles paths and URIs on case-insensitive file systems. Before this release, paths with different casing would not open the same document but separate, disconnected documents. That behavior often caused confusion and sometimes data loss.

However, in fixing these bugs, the behavior of the `openTextDocument` function has changed. The function can now return a document with a URI with different casing than the URI that was passed in. This means extensions should use [TextDocument#uri](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/11fda69d237b9aa006eb53da724fa509afe92e0a/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L99) as the source of truth, not the URI that they request it with.

The sample below illustrates the new behavior:

```ts
// case-insensitive file system

const uriA = vscode.Uri.file('/foo/bar.code');
const docA = await vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(uriA);

const uriB = vscode.Uri.file('/foo/BAR.code');
const docB = await vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(uriB);

assert.ok(docA === docB); // same document
assert.ok(docB.uri.toString() === uriA.toString()); // uriA is used, NOT uriB
assert.ok(docB.uri.toString() !== uriB.toString());
```

### New Debug Console theme colors

There are new colors for styling the Debug Console view:

* `debugConsole.infoForeground`: Foreground color for info messages in Debug Console
* `debugConsole.warningForeground`: Foreground color for warning messages in Debug Console
* `debugConsole.errorForeground`: Foreground color for error messages in Debug Console
* `debugConsole.sourceForeground`: Foreground color for source filenames in Debug Console
* `debugConsoleInputIcon.foreground`: Foreground color for Debug Console input marker icon

### New input theme colors

We also have new color theme option for inputs. You can set the foreground color for active input options via `inputOption.activeForeground`. These appear in the Search view and Find widget (editor, terminal, debug console).

![Input option foreground color](images/1_46/input-option-foreground.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

### New codicon icons

We've added the following new icons to our [codicon](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels) library:

* `server-process`
* `server-environment`
* `record`
* `pass`
* `stop-circle`
* `play-circle`

![Input option foreground color](images/1_46/new-codicons.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Dark Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

### Providers use generic types

Our `vscode.d.ts` typings now makes all two phase providers—ones that have separate 'provide' and 'resolve' methods—generic. The goal was to make it more clear that the results from the 'provide' call are passed it back into the 'resolve' call.

For example, here is the new generic definition of `DocumentLinkProvider`:

```ts
export interface DocumentLinkProvider<T = DocumentLink> {

	provideDocumentLinks(document: TextDocument, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<T[]>;

	resolveDocumentLink?(link: T, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<T>;
}
```

All providers have a default generic argument so this change should not cause any errors with your existing extension. If you were previously using casts or type checks while implementing 'resolve', consider updating your code to use a generic providers instead:

```ts
class MyDocLinkProvider implements DocumentLinkProvider<MyDocumentLink> {

	provideDocumentLinks(document: TextDocument, token: CancellationToken): MyDocumentLink[] { ... }

	resolveDocumentLink(link: MyDocumentLink, token: CancellationToken): MyDocumentLink { ... }
}
```

### Writing theme specific CSS for webviews

The body element of webviews has a new data attribute called `vscode-theme-name` that stores the full name of the currently active theme. This lets you write theme specific css for webviews:

```css
body[data-vscode-theme-name="One Dark Pro"] {
    background: hotpink;
}
```

Keep in mind that given the number of themes that are available for VS Code, you should only write theme specific css in exceptional cases. Normal webview should instead use the `.vscode-light` and `.vscode-dark` class names along with the [VS Code css variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview#theming-webview-content) to write css that adapts to whatever theme the user selects.

### Custom Editors

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Relaxed resolveCompletionItem

The [CompletionItemProvider#resolveCompletionItem](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/11fda69d237b9aa006eb53da724fa509afe92e0a/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L3966) function allows providers to lazily enrich completions with more data. This "lazy" data must be optional and must not change the insert behavior of completions. Extensions can still fill in `additionalTextEdits` and if additional edits arrive **after** a completion has been inserted, the editor will still attempt to apply them. Note that this only applies to additional edits, not to the main edit (`insertText`) which must not change once provided.

### Environment variable collection

The `ExtensionContext.EnvironmentVariableCollection` API is now stable and allows extensions to contribute to terminal environments.

```ts
const collection = context.environmentVariableCollection;
const separator = process.platform === 'win32' ? ';' : ':';
collection.prepend('PATH', `/foo${separator}`);
collection.replace('JAVA_HOME', '/bar');
```

These collections are extension and workspace-specific and VS Code handles how conflicts between multiple extensions are dealt with. They are persisted across window reloads such that terminals created immediately after the window is loaded do not block on the extension host launching but instead use the last known version. These persisted collections are removed by disposing of the collection or when the extension is uninstalled.

When collections change, an indicator will appear on the terminal. Whether this indicator shows for any active change or just for "stale" terminals is defined by the `terminal.integrated.environmentChangesIndicator` setting. This API is now also used by the built-in Git extension to let VS Code be an authentication provider.

## Language Server Protocol

The Language Server libraries maintained in the [vscode-languageserver-node repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node) have been split into a common, node, and browser parts to support using the LSP client and server npm modules in a Web browser via [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Note that this is a breaking change. Consult the [vscode-languageserver-node README](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/blob/master/README.md) for further explanations.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### AccessibilityInformation

We have added `AccessibilityInformation` to the `TreeItem`, `StatusBarItem`, and `TimelineItem` elements to better support screen readers. `AccessibilityInformation` contains a `label` and a `role`. The `label` is read by screen readers and the `role` describes the accessibility characteristics of the element.

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### New instruction breakpoints

A new "instruction" breakpoint type has been introduced which makes it possible to break on an instruction at a memory address. Memory addresses are specified in symbolic form which is optionally available from `evaluate`, `variables`, `stackTrace`, and `gotoTargets` requests. A corresponding client capability `supportsInstructionBreakpoints` indicates whether the debug adapter supports instruction breakpoints.

### Support for "stepping granularity"

A new optional `granularity` argument has been added to the stepping requests `next`, `stepIn`, `stepOut`, `stepBack` to control whether the request steps a "statement", a "line", or an "instruction". A corresponding client capability `supportsInstructionBreakpoints` indicates whether the debug adapter supports the feature.

## Engineering

### Windows ARM64 Insiders

There are new official Insider builds for Windows for ARM 64-bit, available on the [Insiders download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

These go great with the Microsoft Surface Pro X, so give it a try and let us know what you think.

![Windows ARM64](images/1_46/win-arm64.png)

### --crash-reporter-directory argument for diagnosing issues

A new command-line argument `--crash-reporter-directory` allows you to pass a local folder where you'd like to save crash reports. This even works for crashes in the extension host and can be used whenever VS Code is crashing and you want to report an issue.

### Preload Scripts

We have added Electron `preload` scripts to VS Code for exposing certain Electron APIs to the window. This is one of the first steps towards a fully sandboxed window. Progress is outlined in [issue #92164](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92164).

### Extension samples now use ESLint

Contributions to `localization`:

We have keenly listened to your feedback over the past year, and decided it was time to provide a more reliable and interactive platform, where you can contribute to VS Code localization development. With this in mind, we officially decommissioned the Microsoft Localization Community Platform (MLCP) in the first week of April, with the intent of continuing the Microsoft Community Localization Program on an alternative platform for open-source localization projects.

Stay tuned in the upcoming weeks for an announcement on our [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/wiki) page about the new community platform. You can also visit the [FAQ](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/wiki/FAQ) page for answers about this platform transition.
