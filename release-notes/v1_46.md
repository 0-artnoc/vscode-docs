# May 2020 (version 1.46)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.46 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/97432)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

This milestone we again received great feedback from our community, which helped us identify and tackle many [accessibility issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22May+2020%22+is%3Aclosed).

* The Status bar now supports keyboard navigation. When focus is in the Status bar via **Focus Next Part** (`kb(workbench.action.focusNextPart)`), arrow navigation moves between Status bar entries.
* To make it easier to start and end selection using the keyboard, there are four new commands:
  * **Set Selection Anchor** (`kb(editor.action.setSelectionAnchor)`)
  * **Select From Anchor to Cursor** (`kb(editor.action.selectFromAnchorToCursor)`)
  * **Cancel Selection Anchor** (`kb(editor.action.cancelSelectionAnchor)`)
  * **Go to Selection Anchor**
* Activity bar entries now have a `tab` role and set the appropriate `aria-expanded` state.
* Aria labels of editors now properly convey the following editor states: `pinned`, `preview`, and `readonly`.

## Workbench

### Pin Tabs

You can now pin tabs either from the context menu or using the new command `workbench.action.pinEditor` (`kb(workbench.action.pinEditor)`).

![Pin Tabs](images/1_46/pin-tabs.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

 Pinned tabs have a number of useful features to help mark files that are important to you:

* Pinned tabs always appear first before non-pinned tabs.
* They do not scroll out of view if you have many tabs opened.
* They do not close when using commands such as **Close Others**.
* They do not close even if you exceed a set limit on the number of opened editors.

 You can also drag and drop tabs in and out to change the pinned state.

 Pinned tabs visually shrink to the size of an icon (or will show the first letter of the filename if icons are disabled) to save space. If you want to see the dirty indicator with pinned tabs, you can set `workbench.editor.highlightModifiedTabs: true`.

 **Note:** We are still thinking about other ways to present pinned tabs. If you have an opinion, feel free to share your ideas in the existing issues for [showing a secondary tab bar](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/98160) or having a setting to [show more context for pinned tabs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/98161).

### Explorer auto reveal focus without forcing a scroll

There is a new option `focusNoScroll` for the `explorer.autoReveal` setting. When using this option, the Explorer will automatically select files when opening them but will not scroll to reveal them in the Explorer view.

## Source Control

### Open in Terminal

You can now open a repository in a Terminal, from the context menu in the Source Control Providers view.

![Open In Terminal](images/1_46/scm-open-in-terminal.png)

### Add remote from GitHub

You can now easily add a GitHub repository as a remote to your local repositories using the `Git: Add Remote...` command.

![Add Remote](images/1_46/git-add-remote.gif)

### Publish to Github: Generate .gitignore

It's now possible to generate a `.gitignore` file when publishing a workspace to GitHub. When publishing a workspace to GitHub, you are prompted to select which files to include in the repository.

![Publish to Github](images/1_46/publish-to-github.png)

## Debugging

### Automatic debug configurations improvements

This milestone we have improved the experience for automatic debug configurations:

* In the last milestone we've introduced a feature that gives extension authors a means to analyze the current project and offer debug configurations automatically. Since these debug configurations are dynamically created they do not show up in the launch.json, which is nice as long as they work out of the box. But sometimes there is a need to tweak them a bit, for instance by adding an additional argument. To support this scenario we have now added UI to save an automatic debug configuration in the launch.json in order to open it up for editing.
For this we show a gear button at the end of the automatic debug configuration in the **Debug: Select and Start Debugging** Quickpick:

  ![Edit automatic debug configs](images/1_46/edit-auto-configs.gif)

* It is now possible to show all automatic debug configurations from the Run and Debug start view.

  ![Automatic debug configs in start view](images/1_46/automatic-debug-configs.png)

* The Debug dropdown now remembers the previously chosen automatic debug configuration.

### Step Into Targets

Debugging into a statement with many nested function calls can be painful because you might have to step through functions you are not really interested in. To improve this scenario, the Debug Adapter Protocol supports for quite some time the "Step Into Target" feature that enables a UI for directly stepping into the function you are interested in.

In this milestone VS Code has started to leverage this feature. When debugging has stopped on a statement the context menu shows a new action **Step Into Targets**. This action presents a list of all targets (typically functions) that are available at the current stack frame. Selecting one of them will step into that target.
Please note that every stack frame can have its own set of targets. So the result of the **Step Into Targets** actions depends on the currently selected frame in the CALL STACK view.

![Step into targets](images/1_46/step-into.png)

For now, only the Mock Debug extension has (fake) **Step Into Target** support, but soon other debug extensions will follow - such as the Julia debugger.

## Browser support

### Debugging stopped indicator in tab title

When debugging an extension in the browser, the debugged extension shows up in a new browser tab which deactivates (hides) the debugger tab. When the debuggee stops for some reason, e.g. hits a breakpoint, we are not able to activate the debugger tab (because browsers don't provide an API for this). This makes it almost impossible to discover that the debugged extension has stopped.

To alleviate this problem, we now update the tab title to include a red circle indicator 🔴 (resembling a breakpoint). As soon as the debugger tab is activated, the red dot is removed.

![debuggee stopped indicator in web](images/1_46/breakpoint.gif)

### Running VS Code from the Integrated Terminal

Did you know that when you open an Integrated Terminal in VS Code running in the browser, you can type `code` to get access to several useful commands that all work in the browser!

![Terminal Remote](images/1_46/terminal-web.png)

In this iteration, we expanded support for many options:

* `--goto` to open a file on a specific line
* `--diff` to compare two files
* `--wait` to let a program wait for files closing
* `--add` to add a folder to the current workspace

In [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces/), for example, this enables you to use the browser-based VS Code as an editor for Git:

![VS Code Git Editor](images/1_46/code-git-editor.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

### Better file/folder upload

VS Code lets you drop files into the File Explorer to upload them. In this iteration, we improved this feature to allow you to drop folders to upload them, including all child folders and files. Since this can be a long running operation, you will see progress reported in the Status bar and you can cancel the operation if needed.

![Web Upload](images/1_46/web-upload.gif)

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Settings Sync

We have been working the last couple of months to support synchronizing VS Code preferences across machines and this feature is available for preview on the [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) release.

In this milestone we enhanced support for administering and diagnosing Settings Sync.

**Synced Machines View**

We added **Synced Machines** view to show the list of machines synchronising your VS Code preferences. A default name is provided based on the type of VS Code (insiders or stable) and platform you are using, but you can always update the name using the edit action available on the machine entry in the view.

![Synced Machines](images/1_46/settings-sync-machines.png)

*Theme: GitHub Sharp with Customizations*

You can open this view using `Preferences Sync: Show Synced Data` command from the Command Palette.

**Synced Data View**

We added following enhancements to the Synced Data view.

- You can now see the machine from which data is being synced from
- You can now restore to a specific state using the `restore` action available on the data entry in the view.
- You can now reset data on the cloud using the `Reset Synced Data` action available under `...` entry in the view header.

![Synced Data](images/1_46/settings-sync-data.png)

*Theme: GitHub Sharp with Customizations*

We now provide better assistance while turning on sync by checking if you are about to sync with the data from a different machine and allow you in taking an appropriate action.

- `Replace Local` action will replace your data on the current machine with the synced data from the cloud.
- `Merge` action will merge your data on the current machine with the synced data from the cloud.
- `Show Synced Data` action will open Synced Data view to see the synced data from the cloud.

![Merge or Replace](images/1_46/settings-sync-merge.png)

We added protective measures in VS Code to make sure it does not overload the server with too many requests and also improved error handling.

### TS 4.0 support

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Extension authoring

### Filepath-casing matters

We have fixed a couple of bugs how VS Code handles paths and uris on case-insensitive file systems. Before, case-different paths would not open the same document but different, disconnected documents. That often caused confusion and sometimes data loss.

However, fixing these bugs has affected the behaviour of the `openTextDocument`-function. It can now return a document with an uri that is case-different from the uri it was invoked with. This means extensions should use [`TextDocument#uri`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/11fda69d237b9aa006eb53da724fa509afe92e0a/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L99) as source of truth, not the uri that they request it with.

The sample below illustrates the new behaviour:

```ts
// case-insensitive file system

const uriA = vscode.Uri.file('/foo/bar.code');
const docA = await vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(uriA);

const uriB = vscode.Uri.file('/foo/BAR.code');
const docB = await vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(uriB);

assert.ok(docA === docB); // same document
assert.ok(docB.uri.toString() === uriA.toString()); // uriA is used, NOT uriB
assert.ok(docB.uri.toString() !== uriB.toString());
```


### New Debug Console theme colors

There are new colors for styling the Debug Console view:

* `debugConsole.infoForeground`: Foreground color for info messages in debug console
* `debugConsole.warningForeground`: Foreground color for warning messages in debug console
* `debugConsole.errorForeground`: Foreground color for error messages in debug console
* `debugConsole.sourceForeground`: Foreground color for source filenames in debug console
* `debugConsoleInputIcon.foreground`: Foreground color for debug console input marker icon

### Providers use generic types

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### vscode-theme-name

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

```
body[data-vscode-theme-name="One Dark Pro"] {
    background: red;
}
```

### Custom Editors

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Relaxed `resolveCompletionItem`

The [`CompletionItemProvider#resolveCompletionItem`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/11fda69d237b9aa006eb53da724fa509afe92e0a/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L3966)-function allows providers to lazily enrich completions with more data. This "lazy" data must be optional and must not change the insert behaviour of completions. Still, we are now allowing it to fill-in `additionalTextEdits` and in case additional edits arrive _after_ a completion has been inserted the editor will still attempt to apply them. Note that this only applies to additional edits, not to the main edit (`insertText`) which must not change once provided.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### AccessibilityInformation

We have added `AccessibilityInformation` to the `TreeItem`, `StatusBarItem`, and `TimelineItem` elements to better support screen readers. `AccessibilityInformation` contains a `label` and a `role`. The `label` is read by screen readers and the `role` describes the accessibility characteristics of the element.


## Contributions to extensions

## Notebooks

### Quick Outline

Notebooks now support quick outline. Press `kb('workbench.action.gotoSymbol')`, or use F1 > Go to Symbol in Editor, and see a preview of all markdown and code cells of the current notebook

![Notebook Quickoutline](images/1_46/notebook-quickouline.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*


### Error and Symbol Navigation

We have improved how "F8" and "Find All References" work. All code navigtion gestures should feel as natural as they to do outside of notebooks. For instance, the problems view will now show all errors of all cell grouped by the notebook, not by cell anymore:

![Problems pane](images/1_46/notebook-problems.png)

## Engineering

### --crash-reporter-directory argument for diagnosing issues

A new command-line argument `--crash-reporter-directory` allows you to pass a local folder where you'd like to save crash reports. This even works for crashes in the extension host and can be used whenever VS Code is crashing and you want to report an issue.

### Preload Scripts

We have added Electron `preload` scripts to VS Code for exposing certain Electron APIs to the window. This is one of the first steps towards a fully sandboxed window. Progress is outlined in [issue #92164](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92164).

### Extension samples now use ESLint

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command ID
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.pinEditor)`|Pin Editor|`workbench.action.pinEditor`
`kb(workbench.action.unpinEditor)`|Unpin Editor|`workbench.action.unpinEditor`

Contributions to `localization`:

We have keenly listened to your feedback over the past year, and decided it was time to provide a more reliable and interactive platform, where you can contribute to VS Code localization development. With this in mind, we officially decommissioned the Microsoft Localization Community Platform (MLCP) in the first week of April, with the intent of continuing the Microsoft Community Localization Program on an alternative platform for open-source localization projects.

Stay tuned in the upcoming weeks for an announcement on our [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/wiki) page about the new community platform. You can also visit the [FAQ](https://github.com/Microsoft/Localization/wiki/FAQ) page for answers about this platform transition.
