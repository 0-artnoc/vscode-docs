# March 2020 (version 1.44)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.44 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92242)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Quick Open rewrite

The Quick Open (`kb(workbench.action.quickOpen)`) control was using an old version of our tree widget, and in this iteration it was migrated to use our latest list control, already used in the rest of the VS Code UI. Functionally, you should not be able to tell the difference, as all commands will work as before.

We did take this opportunity to add some features that you might find useful.

![Quick Open](images/1_44/quickopen.png)

**Navigate from files to symbols**

You can now continue to navigate to the symbols of a file result simply by typing `@`. For the file that is currently selected, all symbols will appear and the editor will open in the background to reveal the active symbol.

![Quick Open navigate to symbols](images/1_44/quick-open-symbols-access.gif)

**Filter results by separating multiple queries with spaces**

If you are getting too many results for a file search, you can add more search patterns after typing a space. For example, you can narrow down results by folder if you type `<file name> <folder name>` one after the other.

![Quick Open filtering](images/1_44/quick-open-filtering.gif)

**Note:** This also works for the editor (`kb(workbench.action.gotoSymbol)`) and workspace (`kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)`) symbol picker. Any filter after a space character will be used to filter by the container of that symbol.

**Input is preserved when switching providers**

If you leave Quick Open visible and switch to another provider (for example, from file search to symbol search), VS Code will apply whatever filter is typed and use it for the new provider. This allows you to quickly reuse the typed input for symbol search when it was previously used for a file search.

### Sort editor history strictly by recency

A new setting `"search.quickOpen.history.filterSortOrder": "recency"` allows you to sort editor history by the most recently opened items, even when starting to search. By default, editor history results will be sorted by relevance based on the filter pattern that was used.

### Control height of tabs scroll bar

A new setting `workbench.editor.titleScrollbarSizing` lets you increase the size of the scroll bar for editor tabs and breadcrumbs.

Configure it to `large` for a larger scroll bar:

### Improved Extension Pack Representation

To identify extension packs in the extensions view, number badge is shown to indicate the number of extensions included in the extension pack.

![Extension Pack Badge](images/1_44/extension-pack-badge.png)

*Theme: GitHub Sharp with Customizations*

Extension editor's details page now shows all extensions included in the extension pack.

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Settings Sync

In this milestone we enabled synchronizing User Snippets and more UI State.

![Sync Configure](images/1_44/sync-configure.png)

*Theme: GitHub Sharp with Customizations*

Currently following UI State is synchronized:

- Activity Bar entries
- Panel entries
- Views layout and visibility
- Recently used commands
- Do not show again notifications

**Note:** Currently only user language snippets are synchronized and global snippets will be supported in next milestone.

We also added remote and local sync backup views for restoring your data and trouble shooting. You can access these view using commands `Preferences Sync: Show Remote Backup` and `Preferences Sync: Show Local Backup`.

## Contributions to extensions

### Docker

The 1.0 version of the Microsoft [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) extension is now available. The Docker extension helps you build applications using Docker containers. The extension can add required Docker files to your project, build Docker images, let you debug your app inside a container, and includes an Explorer that makes it easy to start, stop, inspect, and remove containers and images.

![Docker extension](images/1_44/docker-extension.png)

Feature highlights in 1.0 include:

* Improved Dockerfile scaffolding for Python Django & Flask web frameworks.
* A Compose.yml file is now optional when adding Docker files to a workspace.
* Node.js, Python, and .NET Core support integrated debugging of a single service using a Dockerfile.
* Work easily with multiple containers and images.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Terminal link handlers

This new API allows extensions to intercept and handle links that are clicked in the terminal.

```ts
window.registerTerminalLinkHandler({
  handleLink((terminal, link) => {
    if (link === 'https://code.visualstudio.com') {
      window.showInformationMessage('Handled');
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  });
});
```

### Contribute to terminal environments

This new API allows extensions to change environment variables when the terminal is starting up.

```ts
const collection = window.getEnviornmentVariableCollection(true);
const separator = process.platform === 'win32' ? ';' : ':';
collection.prepend('PATH', `/foo${separator}`);
collection.replace('JAVA_HOME', '/bar');
```

These collections are extension and workspace-specific and VS Code handles how conflicts between multiple extensions are dealt with. They can optionally be persisted across window reloads, care was taken to ensure this is done in such a way that terminals created immediately after the window is loaded do not block on the extension host launching but instead use the last known version. These persisted collections can get removed by disposing of the collection or create a new non-persistent collection, or when the extension is uninstalled.

The plan is to surface these environment modifications to the user and some indicator that allows updating or "stale" terminal environments but this is still a work in progress. You can follow the discussion in [#46696](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/46696).

## Browser support

### Remote indicator

When using VS Code in a browser, there is now a remote indicator. This lets you know the remote environment you are connected to and allows extensions to add additional commands associated with the remote. With this change, the **Open in Desktop** link was removed from the Status bar and will move into the remote picker.

**Note:** VS Code currently does not support connecting to a different remote - such as SSH, a container, or WSL - from the browser.

![Web remote indicator](images/1_44/web-remote-indicator.png)

### Navigational links

A new menu location lets extensions running in the browser contribute links to the hamburger menu in the upper left.

![Web navigational links](images/1_44/web-navigational-links.png)

## New Commands

We now expose commands for navigating through search results in the Find control from the Editor, Integrated Terminal, Extension Details view, and Webviews.

Key|Command|Command ID
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.alternativeAcceptSelectedQuickOpenItem)`|Alternate Accept Quick Open Item (e.g. "Open to Side")|`workbench.action.alternativeAcceptSelectedQuickOpenItem`
