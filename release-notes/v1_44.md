# March 2020 (version 1.44)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.44 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92242)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Settings Sync

We have been working the last couple of months to support synchronizing VS Code settings, extensions, and keyboard shortcuts across machines and we are happy to announce that this feature is ready for preview from on the [Insider](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) release. You can now have your preferences synchronized in all your VS Code installs across all your machines. You can also bootstrap VS Code with your personal preferences on a fresh machine with minimal effort.

To learn more about turning on and configuring Settings Sync, you can go to the [Settings Sync documentation](https://aka.ms/vscode-settings-sync-help).

## Workbench

### Quick Open rewrite

Quick open (`kb(workbench.action.quickOpen)` and friends) was using a very old version of our tree widget and in this iteration was finally migrated to use our latest list control which is already being used in the rest of the VSCode UI. Visually you should not be able to tell a difference, all commands will work as before.

But we took the time to add some features here and there that you might find useful.

![Quick Open](images/1_44/quickopen.png)

#### Navigate from files into symbols

You can now continue to navigate into symbols of a file result simply by typing `@`. For the file that is currently selected, all symbols will appear and the editor will open in the background to reveal the active symbol.

![Quick Open Narrow into Symbols](images/1_44/quick-open-symbols-access.gif)

#### Narrow down results by separating multiple queries with spaces

If you are getting too many results for a file search, simply add more patterns to search for after typing space. This for example allows you to narrow down results by folder if you type `<file name> <folder name>` one after the other.

![Quick Open Filtering](images/1_44/quick-open-filtering.gif)

**Note:** This also works for editor (`kb(workbench.action.gotoSymbol)`) and workspace (`kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)`) symbols picker: any filter after a space character will be used to filter by the container of that symbol.

#### Input is preserved when switching providers

When you leave quick open visible and switch to another provider (e.g. from file search to symbol search), we take whatever is typed and use it for the new provider. That for example allows to quickly use the typed input for a symbol search when it was used for a file search.

#### New setting to sort editor history strictly by recency

A new setting `"search.quickOpen.history.filterSortOrder": "recency"` allows to sort editor history entries by recency even when starting to search. By default, editor history results will be sorted by relevance based on the filter pattern that was used.

### New setting to control height of tabs scrollbar

A new setting `workbench.editor.titleScrollbarSizing` allows to increase the size of the scrollbar for editor tabs and breadcrumbs. Configure it to `large` for a larger scrollbar:

![Large Scrollbar](images/1_44/large-scrollbar.png)

### Web: remote indicator and navigational links

For VSCode for web we have enabled the remote indicator. This gives you a hint to what remote environment you are connected when using the web version of VSCode and gives extensions a chance to include additional commands associated with the remote. As such, the "Open in Desktop" link was removed from the status bar and will move into the remote picker.

**Note:** we currently do not support to connect to a different remote - such as SSH, containers or WSL - from the web.

![Web Remote Indicator](images/1_44/web-remote-indicator.png)

In addition, a new menu location allows extensions in the web to contribute links to the hamburger menu.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Terminal link handlers

This new API allows extensions to intercept and handle links that are clicked in the terminal.

```ts
window.registerTerminalLinkHandler({
  handleLink((terminal, link) => {
    if (link === 'https://code.visualstudio.com') {
      window.showInformationMessage('Handled');
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  });
});
```

### Contribute to terminal environments

This new API allows extensions to change environment variables when the terminal is starting up.

```ts
const collection = window.getEnviornmentVariableCollection(true);
const separator = process.platform === 'win32' ? ';' : ':';
collection.prepend('PATH', `/foo${separator}`);
collection.replace('JAVA_HOME', '/bar');
```

These collections are extension and workspace-specific and VS Code handles how conflicts between multiple extensions are dealt with. They can optionally be persisted across window reloads, care was taken to ensure this is done in such a way that terminals created immediately after the window is loaded do not block on the extension host launching but instead use the last known version. These persisted collections can get removed by disposing of the collection or create a new non-persistent collection, or when the extension is uninstalled.

The plan is to surface these environment modifications to the user and some indicator that allows updating or "stale" terminal environments but this is still a work in progress. You can follow the discussion in [#46696](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/46696).

## Contributions to extensions

### Docker

The 1.0 version of the Microsoft [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) extension is now available. The Docker extension helps you build applications using Docker containers. The extension can add required Docker files to your project, build Docker images, let you debug your app inside a container, and includes an Explorer that makes it easy to start, stop, inspect, and remove containers and images.

![Docker extension](images/1_44/docker-extension.png)

Feature highlights in 1.0 include:

* Improved Dockerfile scaffolding for Python Django & Flask web frameworks.
* A Compose.yml file is now optional when adding Docker files to a workspace.
* Node.js, Python, and .NET Core support integrated debugging of a single service using a Dockerfile.
* Work easily with multiple containers and images.

## New Commands

We now expose commands for navigating through search results in the Find control from the Editor, Integrated Terminal, Extension Details view, and Webviews.

Key|Command|Command ID
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.alternativeAcceptSelectedQuickOpenItem)`|Alternate Accept Quick Open Item (e.g. "Open to Side")|`workbench.action.alternativeAcceptSelectedQuickOpenItem`

## Notable fixes
