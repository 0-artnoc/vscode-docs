# March 2020 (version 1.44)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.44 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/92242)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Settings Sync

We have been working the last couple of months to support synchronizing VS Code settings, extensions, and keyboard shortcuts across machines and we are happy to announce that this feature is ready for preview from on the [Insider](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) release. You can now have your preferences synchronized in all your VS Code installs across all your machines. You can also bootstrap VS Code with your personal preferences on a fresh machine with minimal effort.

To learn more about turning on and configuring Settings Sync, you can go to the [Settings Sync documentation](https://aka.ms/vscode-settings-sync-help).

## Contributions to extensions

### Docker

The 1.0 version of the Microsoft [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) extension is now available. The Docker extension helps you build applications using Docker containers. The extension can add required Docker files to your project, build Docker images, let you debug your app inside a container, and includes an Explorer that makes it easy to start, stop, inspect, and remove containers and images.

Feature highlights in 1.0 include:

* Improved Dockerfile scaffolding for Python Django & Flask web frameworks.
* A Compose.yml file is now optional when adding Docker files to a workspace.
* Node.js, Python, and .NET Core support integrated debugging of a single service using a Dockerfile.
* Work easily with multiple containers and images.
