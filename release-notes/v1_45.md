# April 2020 (version 1.45)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.45 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/95168)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22April+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

TODO@isidor

## Workbench

### Switch tabs using mouse wheel

When you use the mouse wheel to scroll over editor tabs, you currently cannot switch to the tab, only reveal tabs that are out of view. Now with a new setting `workbench.editor.scrollToSwitchTabs`, this behavior can be changed if you change it to `true`.

![Scroll Tabs](images/1_45/scroll-tabs.gif)

**Note:** You can also press and hold the `Shift` key while scrolling to get the opposite behavior (for example, you can switch to tabs even when the `scrollToSwitchTabs` setting is off).

### Custom window title separator

A new setting `window.titleSeparator` lets you change the separator character that is used in the window title. By default, a dash `'-'` is used.

### New theme colors for editor tabs

Some new colors were added to further theme workbench editor tabs:

* `tab.unfocusedInactiveBackground`: Inactive tab background color in an unfocused group
* `tab.hoverForeground`: Tab foreground color when hovering
* `tab.unfocusedHoverForeground`: Tab foreground color in an unfocused group when hovering

### New theme color for editor title border

The existing color `editorGroupHeader.tabsBorder` changed to render a border below tabs but above breadcrumbs. A new color `editorGroupHeader.border` let you render a border below the editor group header (for example, below breadcrumbs if enabled) to restore the previous behavior of `editorGroupHeader.tabsBorder`.

## Debugging

### Dynamic configurations
TODO@isidor

### New Debug theme colors

Thanks to a [great community PR](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/94838) we have introduced new colors:

* `debugView.exceptionLabelForeground`: Foreground color for a label shown in the CALL STACK view when the debugger breaks on an exception
* `debugView.exceptionLabelBackground`: Background color for a label shown in the CALL STACK view when the debugger breaks on an exception
* `debugView.stateLabelForeground`: Foreground color for a label in the CALL STACK view showing the current session's or thread's state
* `debugView.stateLabelBackground`: Background color for a label in the CALL STACK view showing the current session's or thread's state
* `debugView.valueChangedHighlight`: Color used to highlight value changes in the debug views (ie. in the Variables view)
* `debugTokenExpression.name`: Foreground color for the token names shown in debug views (ie. the Variables or Watch view)
* `debugTokenExpression.value`: Foreground color for the token values shown in debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.string`: Foreground color for strings in debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.boolean`: Foreground color for booleans in debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.number`: Foreground color for numbers in debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.error`: Foreground color for expression errors in debug views

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

## Contributions to extensions

### Remote Development

Work continues on the [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), which allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/master/remote-release-notes/v1_45.md).

## Extension authoring

### Deprecating and archiving of the vscode NPM module

In June 2019, we [split the vscode module](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_36#_splitting-vscode-package-into-typesvscode-and-vscodetest)  into `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test` in light of the `event-stream` incident. Today, a [security alert for minimist](https://snyk.io/blog/prototype-pollution-minimist/) has caused security alerts for extensions that still depend on `vscode`, which depends on `mocha@5.2.0` and therefore `minimist@0.0.8`. Unfortunately, `mocha@5.2.0` no longer receive updates and upgrading to a new `mocha` version would break existing functionalities.

We published a new version of `vscode` that removes some unnecessary dependencies. We also archived the [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-vscode) and deprecated the [vscode module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode) on npm. Please [migrate](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension#migrating-from-vscode) to `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.
