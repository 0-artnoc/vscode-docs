<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.45 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/95168)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22April+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Switch tabs using mouse wheel

When you use the mouse wheel to scroll over editor tabs, you can currently not switch to the tab, only reveal tabs that are out of view. Now with a new setting `workbench.editor.scrollToSwitchTabs` this behaviour can be changed:
* `off`: disables this to preserve today's behaviour (this is the default)
* `natural`: switch to tabs in natural scrolling order
* `reverse`: switch to tabs in reverse scrolling order

**Note:** you can also press and hold the `Shift` key while scrolling to get the opposite behaviour (i.e. you can switch to tabs even with this setting being turned off).

### Allow customize the window title separator

A new setting `window.titleSeparator` allows to change the separator that is used in the window title. By default a dash is used.

## Extension authoring

### New theme colors for editor tabs

Some new colors where added to further theme workbench editor tabs:
* `tab.unfocusedInactiveBackground`: Inactive tab background color in an unfocused group
* `tab.hoverForeground`: Tab foreground color when hovering
* `tab.unfocusedHoverForeground`: Tab foreground color in an unfocused group when hovering

### New theme color for editor title border

The existing color `editorGroupHeader.tabsBorder` changed to render a border below tabs but above breadcrumbs. A new color `editorGroupHeader.border` allows to render a border below the editor group header (i.e. below breadcrumbs if enabled) to restore the previous behaviour of `editorGroupHeader.tabsBorder`.

### Deprecating and archiving of the `vscode` NPM module

In June 2019, we [split the `vscode` module into `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_36#_splitting-vscode-package-into-typesvscode-and-vscodetest) in light of the `event-stream` incident. Today, a [security alert for `minimist`](https://snyk.io/blog/prototype-pollution-minimist/) has caused security alerts for extensions that still depend on `vscode`, which depends on `mocha@5.2.0` and therefore `minimist@0.0.8`. Unfortuantely, `mocha@5.2.0` no longer receive updates and upgrading to a new `mocha` version would break existing functionalities.

We published a new version of `vscode` that removes some unnecessary dependencies. We also archived the [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-vscode) and deprecated the [`vscode` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode) on NPM. Please [migrate](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension#migrating-from-vscode) to `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`.

## Notable fixes
