# April 2020 (version 1.45)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.45 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the April milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/95168)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22April+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

This milestone we have also received great feedback from our community, which helped us identify and tackle many [accessibility issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22April+2020%22+is%3Aclosed).

* We introduced "Focus Next Part" `kb(workbench.action.focusNextPart)` and "Focus Previous Part" `kb(workbench.action.focusPreviousPart)` commands to make it easy to navigate across the workbench
* Status Bar is now accessible and when focused screen readers will read it's content
* Introduced appropriate aria labels in Open Editors, Breadcrumbs and Problems view

## Workbench

### Switch tabs using mouse wheel

When you use the mouse wheel to scroll over editor tabs, you currently cannot switch to the tab, only reveal tabs that are out of view. Now with a new setting `workbench.editor.scrollToSwitchTabs`, this behavior can be changed if you change it to `true`.

![Scroll Tabs](images/1_45/scroll-tabs.gif)

**Note:** You can also press and hold the `Shift` key while scrolling to get the opposite behavior (for example, you can switch to tabs even when the `scrollToSwitchTabs` setting is off).

### Custom window title separator

A new setting `window.titleSeparator` lets you change the separator character that is used in the window title. By default, a dash `'-'` is used.

![Window title separator using dash](images/1_45/window-title-separator.png)

### New theme colors for editor tabs

Some new colors were added to further theme workbench editor tabs:

* `tab.unfocusedInactiveBackground`: Inactive tab background color in an unfocused group
* `tab.hoverForeground`: Tab foreground color when hovering
* `tab.unfocusedHoverForeground`: Tab foreground color in an unfocused group when hovering

### New theme color for editor title border

The existing color `editorGroupHeader.tabsBorder` changed to render a border below tabs but above breadcrumbs. A new color `editorGroupHeader.border` let you render a border below the editor group header (for example, below breadcrumbs if enabled) to restore the previous behavior of `editorGroupHeader.tabsBorder`.

### Updated sidebar section headers for default themes

We've updated the styling of the sidebar section headers for our default Dark and Light themes. We now use a transparent background and show a border for each header.

![Sidebar section headers](images/1_45/sidebar-section-header.png)

## Integrated Terminal

### Removal of several prompt-related commands

The following commands have been removed:

- `workbench.action.terminal.deleteWordLeft`
- `workbench.action.terminal.deleteWordRight`
- `workbench.action.terminal.deleteToLineStart`
- `workbench.action.terminal.moveToLineStart`
- `workbench.action.terminal.moveToLineEnd`

The way these commands worked was by sending a particular sequence to the terminal which was a best effort guess based on what command keybindings terminals use. The problem with these commands was that they were always a black box, you needed to literally search through the vscode codebase to figure out how they work. They have been replaces with custom keybindings for the `workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence` command which does the same thing in a generic way.

These are advanced keyboard shortcuts cannot be viewed in their entirety via the keybindings UI as they contain arguments, you can view them by running the `Preferences: Open Default Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` command:

![](images/1_45/terminal-send-sequence.png)

This should also help teach how to use the [very powerful sendSequence command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal#_send-text-from-a-keybinding).

### Support for pasting of multi-line text in PowerShell

Multi-line pasting never worked in PowerShell as VS Code always sent over the text in exactly the same way as typing it out. As explained above, several keybindings have been swapped to use the `workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence` command, you might have noticed a new keybinding was added for Windows only:

```json
{ "key": "ctrl+v",                "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
                                     "when": "terminalFocus && !accessibilityModeEnabled && terminalShellType == 'pwsh'",
                                     "args": {"text":"\u0016"} },
```

This new keybinding will send the text representing `ctrl+v` directly to the powershell which gets picked up by PSReadLine and handled properly.

### New setting that controls double click word selection

The new `terminal.integrated.wordSeparators` setting enables customization of the double click to select a word behavior.

## Debugging

### Dynamic configurations

We now show dynamic debug configurations providers in the debug view configuration dropdown and in the debug quick pick.
Debug quick pick can be opened by typing `Debug ` in quick pick or by triggering the `Debug: Select and Start Debugging` command.
Once a dynamic configuration provider is chosen we present all the dynamic configurations available and once choosen we start a new debugging session.

This experience should make it easier to start debugging a project out of the box with zero prior configuration and no setting up of `launch.json`. The correct configuration should automatically be detected and provided.

![Dynamic debug configurations](images/1_45/dynamic.gif)

### New Debug theme colors

Thanks to a [great community PR](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/94838) we have introduced new colors:

* `debugView.exceptionLabelForeground`: Foreground color for a label shown in the CALL STACK view when the debugger breaks on an exception
* `debugView.exceptionLabelBackground`: Background color for a label shown in the CALL STACK view when the debugger breaks on an exception
* `debugView.stateLabelForeground`: Foreground color for a label in the CALL STACK view showing the current session's or thread's state
* `debugView.stateLabelBackground`: Background color for a label in the CALL STACK view showing the current session's or thread's state
* `debugView.valueChangedHighlight`: Color used to highlight value changes in the debug views (ie. in the Variables view)
* `debugTokenExpression.name`: Foreground color for the token names shown in debug views (ie. the Variables or Watch view)
* `debugTokenExpression.value`: Foreground color for the token values shown in debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.string`: Foreground color for strings in debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.boolean`: Foreground color for booleans in debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.number`: Foreground color for numbers in debug views
* `debugTokenExpression.error`: Foreground color for expression errors in debug views

### Workspace symbol search includes for all open TypeScript/JavaScript projects

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Improved links in the terminal

Links in the terminal have undergone an overhaul, changing out the backing system that enables them to a much more robust implementation that enables:

- The use of the editor's link detection for better web and `file://` link detection.
- Folder link support, either opening the folder in the explorer or opening a new VS Code window.
- Actioning different link types differently, falling back to "word" links that search the workspace (based on the `terminal.integrated.wordSeparators` setting).
- Similar link highlighting and hover experience to the editor.

### Dynamic View Icons and Titles

This milestone, we continue to improve on the work to make the layout more flexible. Moving views around the workbench allows you to create new icons in the Side Bar or new tabs in the Panel. To make it easier to understand what lives in one of these newly created view containers, we have updated the logic to be easier to understand.

Now, when you have a custom container, we will inherit the title and icon from the first visible view. This will allow you to change it by rearranging the views. For containers that are built-in or from extensions, we will try to preserve this icon as long as possible. Below, you can see that when a new view is placed at the top of the view container, its icon and title are updated.

![Dynamic Icons and Titles](./images/1_45/dynamic-views.gif)

Lastly, you can now move your custom containers around with all of the containing views in one movement. Below, you can see dragging of a Terminal and Output view combination into the Activity Bar.

![Moving Whole Containers](./images/1_45/move-composite.gif)

## Contributions to extensions

### Remote Development

Work continues on the [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), which allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/master/remote-release-notes/v1_45.md).

## Extension authoring

### Deprecating and archiving of the vscode NPM module

In June 2019, we [split the vscode module](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_36#_splitting-vscode-package-into-typesvscode-and-vscodetest)  into `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test` in light of the `event-stream` incident. Today, a [security alert for minimist](https://snyk.io/blog/prototype-pollution-minimist/) has caused security alerts for extensions that still depend on `vscode`, which depends on `mocha@5.2.0` and therefore `minimist@0.0.8`. Unfortunately, `mocha@5.2.0` no longer receive updates and upgrading to a new `mocha` version would break existing functionalities.

We published a new version of `vscode` that removes some unnecessary dependencies. We also archived the [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-vscode) and deprecated the [vscode module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode) on npm. Please [migrate](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension#migrating-from-vscode) to `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`.

### New Completion Item Kinds

We have added two new entries to `vscode.CompletionItemKind` which represent issues and users. This for instance allows you to suggest usernames when adding todo-tags.

### Working with Uris

We have added `vscode.Uri.joinPath`. It is a factory-function that creates new uris by joining path segements with an existing uri. Think of this as Node.js' `path.join`-utility but for uris.

For extensions we now expose the uri at which they are installed via `Extension.extensionUri` and via `ExtensionContext.extensionUri`. With the join-utility you can now create uris for resources of your extension, e.g

```ts

const fileUri = vscode.Uri.joinPath(context.extensionUri, './file.png');
const bytes = await vscode.workspace.fs.readFile(fileUri);
```

### `debug/callstack/context` menu `inline` group

We now support contributions to the `debug/callstack/context` menu `inline` group. Commands contributed to this group will be rendered inline in the call stack when a user hovers over the Debug Session element.

![CallStack Inline](images/1_45/callstack-inline.png)

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Contribute to terminal environments

This new proposed API was introduced last month that enables extension authors to contribute to terminal environments. This month has mainly been applying some UI on top of the feature and polishing it up. There is now a warning icon when a terminal has a "stale" environment that shows a rich hover explaining what's going to change and includes a convenient "Relaunch terminal" action. There's also an info icon available when changes are active but this is disabled by default.
