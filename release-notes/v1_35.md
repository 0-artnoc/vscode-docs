## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.35 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74143)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/milestone/89?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Editor

### Go to Definition Improvements

We have polished 'Go to Definition' and its friends: 'Go to Declaration', 'Go to Type Definition', and 'Go to Implementation'.

* A while back we added the `editor.gotoLocation.multiple: goto`-option which allows to disable showing peek when a symbol has multiple definitions. However, it would show the first definition and ignore the rest. This is now much better: Having multiple results is shown in the status bar and pressing `kb('editor.gotoNextSymbolFromResult')` repeatly reveals them all.
![Go to Definition, no peek](images/1_35/go-to-def-loop.gif)
* Go to definition now honours the `workbench.editor.revealIfOpen`-setting. That means an editor that is already open in another group can be reused (or not) when going to a symbol. *Note* that the old, hard coded, behaviour was to reuse and that the default for `revealIfOpen` is not to reuse
* The peek widget now supports to search and filter the results tree - that allows to quickly narrow down on a result inside a result set.
* Last but not least, a long running request for definitions can now be cancelled with pressing `kb('editor.cancelOperation')`

### Splitting `vscode` package into `@types/vscode` and vscode-test

During the [`event-stream` incident](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/11/26/event-stream) last year, we found that `vscode` package was affected as it pulls in 223 transitive dependencies totaling to 16MB. From time to time, these dependencies also cause GitHub security alerts for all extensions. Since then, we started slimming down `vscode`.

`vscode` package today serves two purposes:
- Pull `vscode.d.ts` for extension development
- Run integration test by downloading and launching a local copy of VS Code

So we split `vscode` into `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`, two packages with more focused functionality.

- [`@types/vscode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/vscode) contains `vscode.d.ts` for each release. For example, `npm i @types/vscode@1.34.0` installs VS Code 1.34 Extension API.
- [`vscode-test`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-test) provides a set of API to run integration test with VS Code. You can learn more about using it in the [Testing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extensionc) page.

The old `vscode` package will continue to work, but new features will go to `vscode-test`. We suggest that you switch over to `vscode-test` which features slimmer dependency graph and a more flexible, explicitly documented API.

Additionally:

- [`vscode-dts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) allows you to to quickly download any version of VS Code API in CLI
- [`vsce`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-vsce) now checks `@types/vscode` version against `engines.vscode` to prevent you from using new API incompatible with old versions of VS Code
- [`helloworld-test-sample`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/helloworld-test-sample), [Testing Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension) page and [Continuous Integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/continuous-integration) page are updated to use `vscode-test`
- [VS Code Extension Generator](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-generator-code) now scaffolds extensions using `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`

### Webviews that set `retainContextWhenHidden` can now receive messages even if they are in the background

Webviews that set `retainContextWhenHidden` can now receive messages even if they are not visible. Previously only visible webviews could receive messages using `.postMessage`.

Keep in mind that in order to provide a good user experience, webviews should not perform complex operations such as DOM manipulation or network requests while in the background.

### Themes: new color for an active tab of an inactive editor group

A new color `tab.unfocusedActiveBackground` allows to control the background color of the active tab in an editor group that does not have focus. This color inherits from the `tab.activeBackground` color.

## Proposed extension APIs

### `DocumentLink.tooltip`

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Notable fixes

* [15749](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/15749): Potential data loss for files that changed on disk meanwhile after a backup was made
* [17115](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/17115): Preserve picked language for files across restarts
