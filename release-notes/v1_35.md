## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.35 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74143)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/milestone/89?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Editor

### Go to Definition improvements

We have polished the **Go to Definition** action and its friends, **Go to Declaration**, **Go to Type Definition**, and **Go to Implementation**.

* Earlier, we added the `editor.gotoLocation.multiple: goto` option to disable showing a Peek view when a symbol has multiple definitions. However, it would only show the first definition and ignore the rest. This is now much better, as multiple results are shown in the Status bar and pressing `kb('editor.gotoNextSymbolFromResult')` repeatedly reveals them all.

* **Go to Definition** now honors the `workbench.editor.revealIfOpen` setting. This means that an editor that is already open in another group can be reused (or not) when going to a symbol. Note that the old, hard-coded behavior was to reuse the current editor and the default for `revealIfOpen` is not to reuse.
* The Peek view now supports search and filter, like the results tree, to allow you quickly narrow down on a result.
* Last but not least, you can now cancel long running requests for definitions by pressing `kb('editor.cancelOperation')`.

### Breadcrumbs displayed

Breadcrumbs are now on by default. This can be toggled in the View menu **View** > **Toggle Breadcrumbs** command.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.5

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Smart selection for JavaScript and TypeScript

JavaScript and TypeScript now support [smart selection](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_33#_smart-select-api). This feature uses semantic knowledge to intelligently expand selections for expressions, types, statements, classes, and imports:

### Extract to type alias refactoring for TypeScript

Use the new **Extract to type alias**  refactoring for TypeScript to quickly extract part type into its own type alias:

![Extracting part of complex type to a type alias](images/1_35/ts-extract-type.gif)

The **Extract to type alias** refactoring has a kind of `refactor.extract.type`. You can configure a single keybinding that extracts either constants or type aliases using:

```json
{
    "key": "shift+ctrl+e",
    "command": "editor.action.codeAction",
    "args": {
        "kind": "refactor.extract",
        "preferred": true
    }
}
```

See the [Code Action](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_keybindings-for-code-actions) documentation for more information on configuring keybindings for refactorings.

### JavaScript and TypeScript and suggestion sorting tweaks

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

## Extension authoring

### Command enablement

<!-- Joh: commands -->

### Webviews that set retainContextWhenHidden can now receive messages even if they are in the background

Webviews that set `retainContextWhenHidden` can now receive messages even if they are not visible. Previously, only visible webviews could receive messages using `.postMessage`.

Keep in mind that in order to provide a good user experience, webviews should not perform complex operations such as DOM manipulation or network requests while in the background.

### New theme color for active tab of an inactive editor group

A new color `tab.unfocusedActiveBackground` allows you to control the background color of the active tab in an editor group that does not have focus. This color inherits from the `tab.activeBackground` color.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### DocumentLink.tooltip

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Notable fixes

* [15749](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/15749): Potential data loss for files that changed on disk meanwhile after a backup was made
* [17115](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/17115): Preserve picked language for files across restarts
