## Workbench

### Link protection for outgoing links

VS Code now shows a prompt before opening outgoing links.

You can open the link directly or trust specific domains to bypass this prompt. With the `Configure Trusted Domains` button or command, you can enable/disable link protection for specific domains or all outgoing links.
