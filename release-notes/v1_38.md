## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.38 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[August iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78844)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22August+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Link protection for outgoing links

VS Code now shows a prompt before opening outgoing links.

![Link Protection](images/1_38/link-protection.gif)

You can open the link directly or trust specific domains to bypass this prompt. With the `Configure Trusted Domains` button or command, you can enable/disable link protection for specific domains or all outgoing links.

### More editor group related context keys

There are two new context keys to bind keyboard shortcuts conditionally: `activeEditorGroupIndex` is a number starting from `0` reflecting the position of an editor group in the editor grid (the group with index `0` visually will be the first one in the top left corner). The other one `activeEditorGroupLast` will be `true` for the last editor group in the editor grid.

### New command to toggle an editor to be maximized

A new action "Toggle Editor Group Sizes" with command ID `workbench.action.toggleEditorWidths` was added that will:
* maximize the active editor group unless maximized already
* even out the editor widths otherwise

### New setting to hide individual macOS touchbar entries

A new setting `keyboard.touchbar.ignored` can be used to selectively remove commands from the macOS touchbar that originate from VSCode. The built in commands that VSCode is adding are:
* `workbench.action.navigateBack`
* `workbench.action.navigateForward`
* `workbench.action.debug.start`
* `workbench.action.debug.run`
* `workbench.action.debug.continue`
* `workbench.action.debug.pause`
* `workbench.action.debug.stepOver`
* `workbench.action.debug.stepInto`
* `workbench.action.debug.stepOut`
* `workbench.action.debug.restart`
* `workbench.action.debug.stop`

## Integrated Terminal

### Improved fallback behavior when using variables in `terminal.integrated.cwd`

When using variables in the cwd such as:

```
"terminal.integrated.cwd": "${fileDirname}"
```

Instead of throwing an error about how a variable cannot be resolved, this will now log an error to the console and fallback to the workspace directory.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Pseudoterminal.onDidClose now accepts a number

The proposed `Pseudoterminal.onDidClose` has changed from an `Event<void>` to an `Event<void | number>`, allowing an extension author to indicate that the terminal or `CustomExecution2` task failed.

## Deprecated proposed terminal APIs removed

The deprecated `TerminalOptions.runInBackground` and `createTerminalRenderer` APIs have both been removed, if you need to migrate off of these you should use `TerminalOptions.hideFromUser` (stable) and `ExtensionTerminalOptions` (proposed) respectively.

## Notable fixes

* [75054](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/75054): macOS simple fullscreen is working again
* [73884](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/73884): Linux: opening files from FTP connection show up empty
* [77735](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77735): workspace.applyEdit drops the TextEdit if there is a RenameFile later
* [77996](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77996): File > Save As moves cursor to beginning of file
