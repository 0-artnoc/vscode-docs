## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.38 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[August iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78844)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22August+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Link protection for outgoing links

VS Code now shows a prompt before opening outgoing links.

![Link Protection](images/1_38/link-protection.gif)

You can open the link directly or trust specific domains to bypass this prompt. With the **Configure Trusted Domains** button or command, you can enable/disable link protection for specific domains or all outgoing links.

### Maximize editor toggle command

A new command **Toggle Editor Group Sizes** (`workbench.action.toggleEditorWidths`) will toggle between maximizing the active editor group and evening out the editor group widths.

### Hide individual macOS Touch Bar entries

A new setting `keyboard.touchbar.ignored` can selectively remove VS Code commands from the macOS Touch Bar. VS Code adds the following commands by default:

* `workbench.action.navigateBack`
* `workbench.action.navigateForward`
* `workbench.action.debug.start`
* `workbench.action.debug.run`
* `workbench.action.debug.continue`
* `workbench.action.debug.pause`
* `workbench.action.debug.stepOver`
* `workbench.action.debug.stepInto`
* `workbench.action.debug.stepOut`
* `workbench.action.debug.restart`
* `workbench.action.debug.stop`

### Go to Line supports negative line numbers

You can now type in negative line numbers to the **Go to Line** picker to navigate from the end of the file. For example, typing `-1` will reveal the last line of the file.

### New editor group context keys

There are two new when clause contexts for conditionally binding keyboard shortcuts:

* `activeEditorGroupIndex` - A number starting from `0` reflecting the position of an editor group in the editor grid. The group with index `0` will be the first in the top left corner.
* `activeEditorGroupLast` - Will be `true` for the last editor group in the editor grid.

## Integrated Terminal

### Improved fallback behavior when using variables in terminal.integrated.cwd

When using variables in the `cwd` such as:

```json
"terminal.integrated.cwd": "${fileDirname}"
```

Instead of throwing an error when a variable cannot be resolved, the terminal will now log an error to the console and fallback to the workspace directory.

## Languages

### Improved Less support

Thanks to a [pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice/pull/135) from Less.js team member [Matthew Dean](https://github.com/matthew-dean), VS Code now supports many new Less.js features including root functions, map lookups and anonymous mixins.

### TypeScript 3.6.1

### Add missing await quick fix

## Extension authoring

### Webview.asWebviewUri and Webview.cspSource

We've added two new properties on webviews:

* `Webview.asWebviewUri` - Convert a URI for the local file system to one that can be used inside webviews.

  For desktop VS Code, this will convert `file:` URIs into `vscode-resource:` URIs.

* `Webview.cspSource` - The content security policy source for webview resources.

  For desktop VS Code, this would be the string `vscode-resource:`.

```ts
const panel = vscode.window.createWebviewPanel(CatCodingPanel.viewType, 'Cat Coding', vscode.ViewColumn.One, {
    // Restrict the webview to only loading local content from our extension's `media` directory.
    localResourceRoots: [vscode.Uri.file(path.join(extensionPath, 'media'))]
});

const imagePath = vscode.Uri.file(path.join(extensionPath, 'media'));

panel.html = `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'; img-src ${panel.webview.cspSource} https:;">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Cat Coding</title>
</head>
<body>
    <img src="${panel.webview.asWebviewUri(imagePath)}/cat.gif" width="300" />
</body>
</html>`
```

### Development warning for creating webview that don't have a content security policy

While developing an extension that uses the [Webview API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview), we now log a warning when you create a webview that does not set a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

![Debug warning for a webview that lacks a CSP](images/1_38/webview-csp-warning.png)

All webviews (even very simple ones) should set a content security policy. This helps limit the potential impact of content injections and is generally a good measure for defense in depth. We've documented how to add a content security policy to VS Code webviews [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview#content-security-policy).

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Pseudoterminal.onDidClose now accepts a number

The proposed `Pseudoterminal.onDidClose` has changed from an `Event<void>` to an `Event<void | number>`, allowing extension authors to indicate that the terminal or `CustomExecution2` task failed.

## Deprecated proposed terminal APIs removed

The deprecated `TerminalOptions.runInBackground` and `createTerminalRenderer` APIs have been removed. If you need to migrate off of these, you should use `TerminalOptions.hideFromUser` (stable) and `ExtensionTerminalOptions` (proposed) respectively.
