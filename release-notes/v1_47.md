# June 2020 (version 1.47)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.47 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/100100)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22June+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

This milestone we again received helpful feedback from our community, which let us identify and tackle many [accessibility issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22June+2020%22+is%3Aclosed). Highlights:

* Compact folders in Explorer now properly narrate expanded, collapsed state and the aria-level.
* Screen readers can now update cursor offset in the editor. As a result the screen reader "Say All" command should work better when stopped and resumed.
* Same aria live messages will now properly be re-read by the screen reader.

## Debugging

### Compact sessions in CALLSTACK view

When debugging simple "one process" JS programs, there is always a top level debug session that clutters the CALL STACK view. In order to make the call stack view more compact we have introduced an option for extensions to opt into compacting debug sessions.
When extensions opt into this behavior debug session that only has one session as a child will be rendered together with that child in one element in the CALL STACK view. All the debug actions on this compact element will get executed on the child debug session.

This should make the CALL STACK view more concise and easier to work with when using the JavaScript debugger.
Other debuggers may opt into this feature in the future, for example Python.

### Debug UX improvements

**Set Next Statement**

To make the command `Jump to Cursor` more discoverable we have decided to introduce a command alias `Set Next Statement`. This new name is more aligned with how other products call this feature. As a reminder this command lets you move program execution to a new location without executing any of the code in between.
More details can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_36#_jump-to-cursor).

**Breakpoint Path on Hover**

When hovering over a breakpoint in the BREAKPOINTS view we now show the absolute path of the breakpoint.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.9.6

VS Code now bundles TypeScript 3.9.6. This minor update fixes a few bugs, including one that could cause the TypeScript server to crash on certain code patterns.

## Preview Features

### TypeScript 4.0 support

This iteration, we've continued improving our support for [TypeScript 4.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0-beta/). Some highlights include:

- Rendering of calls to deprecated symbols in the editor.
- [Improved auto imports](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0-beta/#smarter-auto-imports).
- Surfacing reasons why a given refactoring cannot be applied.

You can try out these features today by installing the [TypeScript nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next).

### Partial IntelliSense support while large JavaScript or TypeScript projects are loading

The TypeScript 4.0 beta also brings a new feature that should help reduce the time you spend waiting while a large JavaScript or TypeScript project is being loading. To explain how this works, we first need to cover a little background on how current versions of TypeScript work.

When you open a JavaScript or TypeScript file in VS Code, the TypeScript language service determine which project that file belongs to and then loads the associated project for it. Sometimes this project can be quite large, such as with the core VS Code codebase which consists of many thousands of TypeScript files. While a project is being loaded, VS Code able to handle basic syntax operations, such as getting the document outline and enabling code folding, but it cannot currently provide IntelliSense or other more advanced language features because they depend on understanding the entire project. In order to provide auto imports for example, the TypeScript language service needs to know all exported symbols in a project.

The changes in TypeScript 4.0 make it possible for VS Code provide IntelliSense and other more advanced language features while a large project is still loading. The caveat is that the IntelliSense we can provide is limited to consulting the current file instead of the entire project. This means that features such as suggestions and go to definition will work, but we will only show suggestions from the current file and you can only run go to definition to jump to another symbol in the current file.

If you work with large JavaScript and TypeScript projects, we are very interested in hearing your feedback on this new feature. You can try it today using the  [TypeScript nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next). Our hope is that it allows you to start work with your code almost instantly until the more complete, project-wide IntelliSense becomes available.

## Browser support

### Large file upload support

You can now upload large files and folders to the web version of VS Code and progress will be reported accurately so that you can track the number of bytes that have been uploaded and the upload speed.

## Contributions to extensions

### Notebooks


**Notebook Hot Exit support**

We have added Hot Exit support in Notebooks to allow extensions to handle backups and restoration. Your unsaved local changes can now be serialized by extensions and restored when the workspace is reopened.

**Undo/Redo enhancement**

We added support for extensions to contribute to the Undo/Redo stacks. Extensions can now control what operations are undoable. For example, in GitHub Issue Notebook, you can click the Lock button to make the cell content readonly, and also undo/redo this operation through the normal Undo/Redo commands.

![Undo/Redo GitHub Notebook](images/1_47/notebook-undo-redo.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*


**Create Untitled Notebook**

We extended New File command (`kb(workbench.action.files.newUntitledFile)`) to support creating new untitled notebook files. For example, you can use below keybindings to quickly create a github issue notebook and run queries

```json
{
    "key": "cmd+i",
    "command": "workbench.action.files.newUntitledFile",
    "args": { "viewType": "github-issues" }
}
```

*Theme: [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*



## Extension authoring

### AccessibilityInformation

We have finalized the `AccessibilityInformation` in the `TreeItem`, `StatusBarItem`, and `TimelineItem` elements to support screen readers. `AccessibilityInformation` contains a `label` and a `role`. The `label` is read out by a screen reader once the item has focus. `role` of the item defines how a screen reader interacts with it. The `role` should be set in special cases when for example a tree-like element behaves like a checkbox. If `role` is not specified VS Code will pick the appropriate `role` automatically.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Terminal link provider

Building on top of [the terminal's new link system added in the previous release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_46#_improved-link-support), this new proposal `window.registerLinkProvider` allows an extension to attach links to the terminal, including a tooltip label that is displayed on hover.

![Web Upload](images/1_47/terminal-link-provider.png)

This contrasts with the previously proposed (now deprecated) ["link handler" API](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_44#_terminal-link-handlers) which would allow your extension to possibly handle the link in question, and if it doesn't there would be a fallback chain. This new model where links will definitely be handled fits in better with the vision in mind where links could have a list of possible actions.

### noDebug in DebugSessionOptions

We have introduced the `noDebug` property to `DebugSessionOptions` in the `startDebugging` API. `noDebug` controls whether the session about to start should run without debugging, thus ignoring breakpoints.
When `noDebug` property is not specified, the value from the parent session (if there is one) is used.

> It was previously possible for extensions to achieve this behavior by passing the `noDebug` flag inside the launch configuration. However this is now deprecated but still supported and we suggest that extensions transition to using the `noDebug` flag in `DebugSessionOptions`

### compact in DebugSessionOptions

We have introduced the `compact` property to `DebugSessionOptions` in the `startDebugging` API. `compact` controls if the debug session's parent session is shown in the CALL STACK view if it has only a single child. By default, the debug session will never hide its parent. If `compact` is true, the parent of the created debug sessions will get hidden in the CALL STACK view as long as it only has a single child.

## Editor

### Case changing in regex replace

We now have support for changing the case of regex matching groups while doing a find/replace in the editor. This is done with the modifiers `\u\U\l\L`, where `\u` and `\l` will upper/lowercase a single character, and `\U` and `\L` will upper/lowercase the rest of the matching group.

Example:

![Changing case in replace](images/1_47/case-change-replace.gif)

The modifiers can also be stacked - for example, `\u\u\u$1` will uppercase the first 3 characters of the group, or `\l\U$1` will lowercase the first character, and uppercase the rest.

Currently, these are only supported in the editor's find widget, and not in "Find in Files".

## Engineering

### Using TypeScript 4.0 to build VS Code

VS Code is now built using a [nightly build](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) of TypeScript 4.0.

This new TypeScript version helped us catch a few [potential bugs around accessors](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0-beta/#breaking-changes) and also helps us test the upcoming TypeScript release.
