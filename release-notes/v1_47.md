# June 2020 (version 1.47)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.47 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/100100)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22June+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

This milestone we again received helpful feedback from our community, which let us identify and tackle many [accessibility issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22June+2020%22+is%3Aclosed). Highlights:

* Compact folders in Explorer now properly narrate expanded, collapsed state and the aria-level.
* Screen readers can now update cursor offset in the editor. As a result the screen reader "Say All" command should work better when stopped and resumed.
* Same aria live messages will now properly be re-read by the screen reader.

## Debugging

In this milestone we've focused on UI and usability improvements.

### Single file debugging

Until today VS Code debugging has no standard way to convey to users that a file in the editor can be easily debugged with just a click of a button.
Some debug extensions contribute a debug configuration "Debug file in editor" with that purpose, but users still have to select the correct configuration in the debug configuration drop down menu before they can use "F5".
Other debug extensions implement a fall back strategy for "F5": if no launch.json exists, "F5" will try to debug the file currently open in the active editor.

Since both approaches are not easily discoverable, some debug extensions (e.g. Python) have started to add a "Run" button to the editors title area.

Since we haven't found any better approach and since this approach can be implemented without any need for new APIs, we have just written down some guidelines for how to implement this in a standard way.
Extension authors can find these guidelines below in the "Extension Authoring" section.

Users need only to remember these icons:

![Run and debug action in editor title](images/1_47/run-and-debug-actions.png)

If one or both show up on the left hand side of the editor's title area, then running or debugging the file in the editor is just one click away...

### Less cluttered CALL STACK view

We've started to make the CALL STACK less crowded for common cases: the CALL STACK view now supports to hide debug session nodes that exist for technical reasons but do not provide much value to users.

The first debug extension that has opted into this feature is the new JavaScript debugger which could eliminate a parent debug session whenever there is only a single child session.

![Less crowded CALL STACK view](images/1_47/less-crowded-callstack.png)

We hope that other debug extensions will follow. Please see the new proposed API below.

### New command alias **Set Next Statement** for **Jump to Cursor**

To make the command `Jump to Cursor` more discoverable for users coming from VisualStudio we've added the command alias `Set Next Statement`.

If you don't know what `Jump to Cursor` does: it lets you move program execution to a new location without executing any of the code in between.

### Breakpoint Path on Hover

When hovering over a source breakpoint in the BREAKPOINTS view we now show the absolute path of the breakpoint.

## Workbench

### Edit object settings from the settings editor

So far, the settings editor could only be used to edit settings of primitive types. Now, you can edit non-nested object settings from the settings editor. Extension authors can leverage this functionality to increase the visibility of these kinds of settings.

![Edit object settings from the settings editor](images/1_47/object-settings-editor.jpg)


## Languages

### TypeScript 3.9.6

VS Code now bundles TypeScript 3.9.6. This minor update fixes a few bugs, including one that could cause the TypeScript server to crash on certain code patterns.

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Settings Sync

We have been working the last couple of months to support synchronizing VS Code preferences across machines and this feature is available for preview on the [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders) release.

- You can now disable sync on other machine using **Turn off Preferences Sync** context menu action on the machine entry in **Synced Machines** view.

![Turn off Sync on Machine](images/1_47/settings-sync-turn-off-machine.png)

- Improved progress information when turning on sync.

### TypeScript 4.0 support

This iteration, we've continued improving our support for [TypeScript 4.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0-beta/). Some highlights include:

- Rendering of calls to deprecated symbols in the editor.
- [Improved auto imports](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0-beta/#smarter-auto-imports).
- Surfacing reasons why a given refactoring cannot be applied.

You can try out these features today by installing the [TypeScript nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next).

### Partial IntelliSense support while large JavaScript or TypeScript projects are loading

The TypeScript 4.0 beta also brings a new feature that should help reduce the time you spend waiting while a large JavaScript or TypeScript project is being loading. To explain how this works, we first need to cover a little background on how current versions of TypeScript work.

When you open a JavaScript or TypeScript file in VS Code, the TypeScript language service determine which project that file belongs to and then loads the associated project for it. Sometimes this project can be quite large, such as with the core VS Code codebase which consists of many thousands of TypeScript files. While a project is being loaded, VS Code able to handle basic syntax operations, such as getting the document outline and enabling code folding, but it cannot currently provide IntelliSense or other more advanced language features because they depend on understanding the entire project. In order to provide auto imports for example, the TypeScript language service needs to know all exported symbols in a project.

The changes in TypeScript 4.0 make it possible for VS Code provide IntelliSense and other more advanced language features while a large project is still loading. The caveat is that the IntelliSense we can provide is limited to consulting the current file instead of the entire project. This means that features such as suggestions and go to definition will work, but we will only show suggestions from the current file and you can only run go to definition to jump to another symbol in the current file.

If you work with large JavaScript and TypeScript projects, we are very interested in hearing your feedback on this new feature. You can try it today using the  [TypeScript nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next). Our hope is that it allows you to start work with your code almost instantly until the more complete, project-wide IntelliSense becomes available.

## Browser support

### Large file upload support

You can now upload large files and folders to the web version of VS Code and progress will be reported accurately so that you can track the number of bytes that have been uploaded and the upload speed.

![Web Upload](images/1_47/web-upload.gif)


### Towards text file encoding support

During this milestone a lot of work went into full support for text encodings in the browser for reading and writing files. We rely on 2 libraries that are now supported in browsers by leveraging webpack:
* [`iconv-lite`](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite) to read and write encodings
* [`jschardet`](https://github.com/aadsm/jschardet): to guess encodings from textual content

This work will continue in July and should be generally available very soon.

Special thanks to [Fedor Nezhivoi (@gyzerok)](https://github.com/gyzerok) for driving this work via pull requests.

## Contributions to extensions

### Notebooks


**Notebook Hot Exit support**

We have added Hot Exit support in Notebooks to allow extensions to handle backups and restoration. Your unsaved local changes can now be serialized by extensions and restored when the workspace is reopened.

**Undo/Redo enhancement**

We added support for extensions to contribute to the Undo/Redo stacks. Extensions can now control what operations are undoable. For example, in GitHub Issue Notebook, you can click the Lock button to make the cell content readonly, and also undo/redo this operation through the normal Undo/Redo commands.

![Undo/Redo GitHub Notebook](images/1_47/notebook-undo-redo.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*


**Create Untitled Notebook**

We extended New File command (`kb(workbench.action.files.newUntitledFile)`) to support creating new untitled notebook files. For example, you can use below keybindings to quickly create a github issue notebook and run queries

```json
{
    "key": "cmd+i",
    "command": "workbench.action.files.newUntitledFile",
    "args": { "viewType": "github-issues" }
}
```

![Create Untitled GitHub Notebook](images/1_47/notebook-create-untitled.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*



## Extension authoring

### AccessibilityInformation

We have finalized the `AccessibilityInformation` in the `TreeItem`, `StatusBarItem`, and `TimelineItem` elements to support screen readers. `AccessibilityInformation` contains a `label` and a `role`. The `label` is read out by a screen reader once the item has focus. `role` of the item defines how a screen reader interacts with it. The `role` should be set in special cases when for example a tree-like element behaves like a checkbox. If `role` is not specified VS Code will pick the appropriate `role` automatically.

### Fallback message for "go to location"

The `editor.action.goToLocations`-command can now show a fallback message when no locations could be found. This allows extensions to implement features like "Go to Super Type" that behave just like built-in features, e.g like "Go to Definition". The snippet below is a full sample of an extension invoking this command:

```ts
vscode.commands.executeCommand(
	'editor.action.goToLocations',
	vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri, //anchor uri and position
	vscode.window.activeTextEditor.selection.start,
	[], // results (vscode.Location[])
	'goto', // mode
	'No Super Types Found' // <- message
);
```

### Guidelines for improving the single file debug experience

### New Extension Categories

You can now use following newly added categories to categorise your extensions.

- Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Visualization
- Testing
- Notebooks

## Language Server Protocol

Support for [semantic tokens](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/#textDocument_semanticTokens) and lazy resolving of additional text edits in [completion items](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/#textDocument_completion) has been added to the upcoming [3.16](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16) specification.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Terminal link provider

Building on top of [the terminal's new link system added in the previous release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_46#_improved-link-support), this new proposal `window.registerLinkProvider` allows an extension to attach links to the terminal, including a tooltip label that is displayed on hover.

![Terminal Link Provider](images/1_47/terminal-link-provider.png)

This contrasts with the previously proposed (now deprecated) ["link handler" API](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_44#_terminal-link-handlers) which would allow your extension to possibly handle the link in question, and if it doesn't there would be a fallback chain. This new model where links will definitely be handled fits in better with the vision in mind where links could have a list of possible actions.

### New API for "Run without Debugging"

VS Code's "Run without Debugging" feature is a variant of debugging where an existing debug configuration is re-used for running a program instead of debugging it. A consequence of this run mode is that the program does not break into the debugger, neither for hitting breakpoints nor for any other reason.

In this milestone we provide official extension API for "Run without Debugging": a new property `noDebug` has been added to the `DebugSessionOptions` of the `debug.startDebugging` function. `noDebug` controls whether the session about to start should run with or without debugging. When the `noDebug` property is missing, the value from the parent session (if there is one) is used. If there is no parent session, the value 'false' is assumed for a missing `noDebug` property.

Please note: Previously it was possible to add a `noDebug` flag to a launch configuration to achieve the same effect. However this unofficial API is now deprecated (but still supported) and we suggest that extensions transition to the new API.

### New API for reducing clutter in the CALLSTACK view

With the arrival of sophisticated debug extensions and debug setups, more debug sessions show up in the CALL STACK tree view and make them look crowded.
In most cases the debug sessions are useful to users and they need to have full control over them. In other cases some debug sessions are just implementation artifacts or a grouping mechanism for a set of child sessions.

In order to make the CALL STACK view less crowed in common cases, we have introduced a feature to hide a parent debug session node if it only has a single child session.
This feature is called "compact mode" and is available through a new optional `compact` property on the `DebugSessionOptions` of the `debug.startDebugging` function.

If `compact` is true, the parent of the newly created debug session will be hidden in the CALL STACK view as long as it only has a single child.
If `compact` is false or missing, the parent node stays visible (which is the current behavior).

## Editor

### Case changing in regex replace

We now have support for changing the case of regex matching groups while doing a find/replace in the editor. This is done with the modifiers `\u\U\l\L`, where `\u` and `\l` will upper/lowercase a single character, and `\U` and `\L` will upper/lowercase the rest of the matching group.

Example:

![Changing case in replace](images/1_47/case-change-replace.gif)

The modifiers can also be stacked - for example, `\u\u\u$1` will uppercase the first 3 characters of the group, or `\l\U$1` will lowercase the first character, and uppercase the rest.

Currently, these are only supported in the editor's find widget, and not in "Find in Files".

## Source Control

### View & Sort

We have added support for sorting your changes in the source control viewlet by name, path (default), and state when using the list view option. We have consolidated the view options (list vs. tree) and sort options into a new `View & Sort` menu item in the context menu.

![View & Sort](images/1_47/scm-view&sort.png)

## Extensions

### Install VSIX through drag'n'drop

We have added support by installing a VSIX file through drag'n'drop onto the Extensions viewlet.

## Engineering

### Using TypeScript 4.0 to build VS Code

VS Code is now built using a [nightly build](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) of TypeScript 4.0.

This new TypeScript version helped us catch a few [potential bugs around accessors](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0-beta/#breaking-changes) and also helps us test the upcoming TypeScript release.
