# June 2020 (version 1.47)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.47 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/100100)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22June+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

This milestone we again received helpful feedback from our community, which let us identify and tackle many [accessibility issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22June+2020%22+is%3Aclosed). Highlights:

* Compact folders in Explorer now properly narrate expanded, collapsed state and the aria-level.
* Screen readers can now update cursor offset in the editor. As a result the screen reader "Say All" command should work better when stopped and resumed.
* Same aria live messages will now properly be re-read by the screen reader.

## Debugging

### Compact sessions in CALLSTACK view

TODO@isidor

### Debug UX improvements

**Set Next Statement**

To make the command `Jump to Cursor` more discoverable we have decided to introduce a command alias `Set Next Statement`. This new name is more aligned with how other products call this feature. As a reminder this command lets you move program execution to a new location without executing any of the code in between.
More details can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_36#_jump-to-cursor).

**Breakpoint Path on Hover**

When hovering over a breakpoint in the BREAKPOINTS view we now show the absolute path of the breakpoint.

## Browser support

### Large file upload support

You can now upload large files to the web version of VS Code and progress will be reported accurately so that you can track the number of bytes that have been uploaded and the upload speed.

## Extension authoring

### AccessibilityInformation

We have finalized the `AccessibilityInformation` in the `TreeItem`, `StatusBarItem`, and `TimelineItem` elements to support screen readers. `AccessibilityInformation` contains a `label` and a `role`. The `label` is read out by a screen reader once the item has focus. `role` of the item defines how a screen reader interacts with it. The `role` should be set in special cases when for example a tree-like element behaves like a checkbox. If `role` is not specified VS Code will pick the appropriate `role` automatically.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Terminal link provider

Building on top of [the terminal's new link system added in the previous release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_46#_improved-link-support), this new proposal `window.registerLinkProvider` allows an extension to attach links to the terminal, including a tooltip label that is displayed on hover.

This contrasts with the previously proposed (now deprecated) ["link handler" API](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_44#_terminal-link-handlers) which would allow your extension to possibly handle the link in question, and if it doesn't there would be a fallback chain. This new model where links will definitely be handled fits in better with the vision in mind where links could have a list of possible actions.

## New commands
