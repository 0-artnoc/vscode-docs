## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.34 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/71830)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/92?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Languages

### Lower rank for CSS property values with vendor prefix

CSS property values prefixed with dash `'-'` (such as `-moz-grid` or `-ms-grid`), now come after `grid` in auto completion.

## Extension Development

### Multi Extension Debugging

In this milestone we've added support for debugging more than one extension at a time. This is useful if you are developing a set of tightly coupled or interdependent extensions.

Currently this feature is only surfaced via the command line interface of VS Code: the argument `--extensionDevelopmentPath` can now be specified more than once.
Typically `--extensionDevelopmentPath` is used in the launch configuration of an extension. When developing more than one extension we recommend to combine the individual extension projects into a multi-folder workspace and create a new launch configuration (located in the workspace settings) that uses multiple `--extensionDevelopmentPath` arguments for the individual extensions.

Here is an example workspace file with two extensions `hello1` and `hello2` and a single launch configuration for both extensions:

```js
{
  "folders": [
    { "path": "hello1" },
    { "path": "hello2" }
  ],
  "launch": {
    "configurations": [
      {
        "type": "extensionHost",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Launch Two Extensions",
        "args": [
          "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder:hello1}",
          "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder:hello2}",
        ],
        "outFiles": [
          "${workspaceFolder:hello1}/out/**/*.js",
          "${workspaceFolder:hello2}/out/**/*.js"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Please note: in this release it is not easily possible to configure a `preLaunchTask` that builds both extensions by combining the `preLaunchTask`s of the individual extension projects.
