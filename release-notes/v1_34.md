## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the April 1.34 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[April iteration plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/71830)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/92?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Languages

### Lower rank for CSS property values with vendor prefix

CSS property values prefixed with dash `'-'` (such as `-moz-grid` or `-ms-grid`), now come after `grid` in auto completion.

## Extension authoring

### Multi-extension debugging

In this milestone, we've added support for debugging more than one extension at a time. This is useful if you are developing a set of tightly coupled or interdependent extensions.

Currently this feature is only surfaced via the command line interface of VS Code: the argument `--extensionDevelopmentPath` can now be specified more than once. Typically `--extensionDevelopmentPath` is used in the launch configuration of an extension. When developing more than one extension, we recommend combining the individual extension projects into a multi-folder workspace and create a new launch configuration (located in the workspace settings) that uses multiple `--extensionDevelopmentPath` arguments for the individual extensions.

Here is an example workspace file with two extensions, `hello1` and `hello2`, and a single launch configuration for both extensions:

```js
{
  "folders": [
    { "path": "hello1" },
    { "path": "hello2" }
  ],
  "launch": {
    "configurations": [
      {
        "type": "extensionHost",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Launch Two Extensions",
        "args": [
          "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder:hello1}",
          "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder:hello2}",
        ],
        "outFiles": [
          "${workspaceFolder:hello1}/out/**/*.js",
          "${workspaceFolder:hello2}/out/**/*.js"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Please note that in this release, it is not possible to create a `preLaunchTask` that builds both extensions by combining the `preLaunchTask`s of the individual extension projects.

### Command links in notifications

It was always possible to include links in notification messages via the syntax `[link name](http://link)`, but this only worked for links that open in a browser. Now you can also invoke a command from a link with the syntax `[link name](command:<command id>)`. The command with the provided identifier will be triggered when the user clicks the link.

### Links in notifications allow for title

You can now add a title to links in notifications that will be shown when the user hovers over the link. The syntax is `[link name](link "<the title>")`.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### vscode.workspace.workspaceFile

There is a new workspace property returning the location of the workspace file. For example: `file:///Users/name/Development/myProject.code-workspace` or `untitled:1555503116870` for a workspace that is untitled and not yet saved.

Depending on the workspace that is opened, the value will be:

* `undefined` when no workspace or a single folder is opened.
* The path of the workspace file as `Uri`.

If the workspace is untitled, the returned URI will use the `untitled:` scheme.

One use of the workspace file location is to call the `vscode.openFolder` command to open the workspace again after it has been closed:

```typescript
  vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.openFolder', uriOfWorkspace);
```

**Note:** It is not recommended using the `workspace.workspaceFile` location to write configuration data directly into the file. You can use `workspace.getConfiguration().update()` which will work both when a single folder is opened as well as an untitled or saved workspace.

## Engineering

### Rewritten filesystem provider for local files

For a while we have supported extensions to provide their own filesystem implementations for custom resources ([read more here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_23#_filesystem-providers)). However, our own implementation for local files was not implemented with the same APIs. This resulted in subtle differences of behaviour when dealing with local file resources compared to ones that were coming in from extensions. During the last 2 milestones we [rewrote our file system provider](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/services/files/node/diskFileSystemProvider.ts) for local files to use the same APIs and as such the behaviour is now consistent.

## Notable fixes

* [48259](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/48259): Explorer Respects Trash Capability from FileSystemProvider
* [68276](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/68276): Call Stack "Paused On Breakpoint" UI not visible for long thread names
* [72110](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/72110): Debug Console render newlines unnecessary
* [71737](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/71737): Scrolling in debug window is behaving strange
* [71588](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/71588): Error revealing files in the explorer
