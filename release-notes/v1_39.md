## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.39 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[September iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80591)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### New title variable to indicate the remote name

A new variable was added that can be used for the `window.title` setting. Use `remoteName` to include the name of the remote you are connected to. See the [Remote Development overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) for more information about remote development with VS Code.

### Improved Trusted Domains setting

We simplified the management of trusted domains for the [outgoing link protection](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38#_link-protection-for-outgoing-links) feature introduced in the 1.38 release.

You can now use the command **Manage Trusted Domains** to easily add, remove, or modify trusted domains as a JSON text file.

![Improved trusted domains management](images/1_39/improved-trusted-domains-management.gif)

### Selectable completion details

Auto completion's details can now be selected for copy and paste.

![Selectable completion details](images/1_39/selectable-completion-details.gif)

### Updated Japanese UI font on Windows

On Windows, we have switched the Japanese UI typeface from `Meiryo` to `Yu Gothic UI` and `Meiryo UI`.

The `UI` typefaces save horizontal space by using narrower Japanese kana characters. You can use the Japanese UI by installing the [Japanese Language Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-CEINTL.vscode-language-pack-ja) and **Configure Display Language** to `ja`.

![Japanese typeface](images/1_39/japanese-typeface.png)

### Improved monospace typeface display in suggestions and hovers

Previously, the inline `<code>` segments in the suggestion and hover widgets didn't specify `font-family`. On Windows / macOS, these segments are rendered with Chrome's default choice for `font-family: monospace`.

In this iteration, we aligned them with the system sans-serif typefaces that is used throughout the VS Code UI.

* Windows: `Courier New` -> `Consolas` (To align with `Segoe UI`)
* macOS: `Courier` -> `SF Mono`, `Monaco`, `Menlo` (To align with `SF Text` and `Helvetica Neue`)
* Linux: No change. Inline code segments still rendered in `Liberation Mono`, which is Chrome's default for `font-family: monospace` on Linux.

![Suggest and Hover widgets monospace typeface](./images/1_39/suggest-hover-widgets-monospace-typeface.png)

### Validation for uniqueItems in the Settings editor

[Validation for string array settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38#_validation-for-string-array-settings), which was introduced in the 1.38 release, now supports `uniqueItems`.

If using `"uniqueItems": true`, duplicate entries in the Settings editor will show a warning.

### Code block highlighting in extension READMEs

Code blocks in extension READMEs are now highlighted in VS Code:

![A block of json code being highlighted](./images/1_39/extension-readme-highlighting.gif)

The highlighting uses the current [color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes).

### Image preview moved to a built-in extension

VS Code's image preview functionality has been moved out of the core codebase and into a built-in `Image Preview` extension. The functionality of image previews should be almost exactly the same as before.

![The built-in image preview extension](./images/1_39/image-preview-extension.png)

Extracting image preview into a built-in extension makes it easier to fix bugs in it and add features, and will eventually also allow extensions to override VS Code's built-in image preview more easily.

This change was enabled by the [custom editor api](#readonly-webview-editors-for-resources) work we completed this iteration.

## Editor

### Toggle folding

You can now expand and collapse a folding region with the same command: `Toggle Fold (Ctrl + K Ctrl + L)`

## Integrated Terminal

### Automatic tunneling of localhost links in remote integrated terminals

When connected to [remote workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote), clicking `http` or `https` localhost links in the integrated terminal will now transparently open a tunnel so that your local machine can view resources from the remote machine. The gif below shows this behavior running the `http-server` utility in a remote SSH workspace.

![Tunneling when clicking on a localhost link in a remote terminal](./images/1_39/terminal-tunnel.gif)

Notice how when the link to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` is clicked, we open the local browser to `http://127.0.0.1:53507`. Behind the scenes, VS Code has automatically established a secure tunnel that connects port 53507 on the local machine to port 8080 on the remote.

## Languages

### CSS property completion with semicolon

CSS property completion now inserts a semicolon at the end of a line.

You can use this feature with `kbstyle(Ctrl+Enter)` (Windows / Linux) or `kbstyle(Cmd+Enter)` (macOS) to open new line without pushing the ending `;` to a new line.

You can control this feature with `[css|scss|less].completion.completePropertyWithSemicolon` setting.

![CSS property completion semicolon](./images/1_39/css-property-completion-semicolon.gif)

### CSS color swatch for variable completion

When completing CSS variables, if the original variable is a color string, VS Code now shows the completion item with its color:

![CSS color swatch variable](./images/1_39/css-color-swatch-variable.png)

### `markdown.links.openLocation`

The new `markdown.links.openLocation` setting controls where links within markdown files are opened. It has two values:

- `"currentGroup"` — (default) Opens links in the current editor group.
- `"beside"` — Open links to the side of the current markdown editor.

`"markdown.links.openLocation": "beside"` can be useful for working on documentation.

## Integrated Terminal

### Open new terminals with custom working directories

There is a new command available that allows the creation of terminals with custom cwds:

```json
{
  "key": "cmd+shift+h",
  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.newWithCwd",
  "args": {
    "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
  }
}
```

The cwd can either be a normal path or a [variable](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference).

### Better locale detection

The `terminal.integrated.setLocaleVariables` setting has been replaced with the new `terminal.integrated.detectLocale` setting. The default value is `"auto"` which will set the `$LANG` variable in your terminal session to the detected language UTF-8 value but only when it looks like it has not already been configured by the user. This better default should lead to less issues related to language and encoding in the terminal.

## Debugging

### Improved UI for column breakpoints

While debugging we now show all the breakpoint candidate locations inline. This makes it easier for the user to place a breakpoint on a more accurate position. To not clutter the UI too much we only show breakpoints candidate locations if there is more than 1 location at the line.

All the inline breakpoint decorations can now be interacted with, by clicking you can enable and disable them and you can also invoke the context menu for more actions.

![breakpoints](./images/1_39/breakpoints.gif)


Note that this feature requires specific support by an underlying runtime or debugger, and we expect only a few debug extensions to use this feature in the future. For this release, **Node Debug** and the **Debugger for Chrome** support this. As an example for other extensions our [Mock Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andreweinand.mock-debug) "mocks" support for this.

### Inline debug actions available in CALL STACK view

When there are sessions or threads shown in the CALL STACK view we show debug actions inline on hover.
This will make it easier to control the debug flow when debugging mulitple sessions or threads. Now it is no longer necessery to first focus a session or thread in order to perform an action on it.

If a session has only one thread then we show all the actions on the session since the thread is not displayed. Otherwise we show all the actions in their context (session actions on sessions and thread actions on threads).

![callstack](./images/1_39/callstack.gif)


### Improved CALL STACK view behavior

We improved some functionality in the call stack:
* Clicking on the debug session or the thread no longer expands them. You have to click on the twistie expando directly. Reason for this is that now it is possible to just move focus to a session or thread without expanding it accidentally.
* We no longer automatically focus new debug sessions if they did not break.

### Improved link detection in debug console

We now also detect links in expressions in debug console, not only in string output as before. This means that link detection will be performed in more places in the debug console. We have also improved our link detection algorithm.


### PreLaunchTask can now refer to default build

With the introduction of a new variable `${defaultBuildTask}`, it is now possible to have a generic `preLaunchTask` that always refers to the default build task:

```json
{
    "name": "Hello World",
    "type": "node",
    "request": "launch",
    "preLaunchTask": "${defaultBuildTask}"
}
```

`${defaultBuildTask}` resolves to the name of the task that is run when the command Tasks: Run Build Task is executed. Similarly to the command, if there are multiple default build tasks, or no default build tasks, then a quick pick is show to select which build task to use.

### Save choice of what to do in case of "preLaunchTask" errors

It is now possible to remember the choice of what to do in case of a `preLaunchTask` error.
The choice is stored in settings under a new setting `debug.onTaskErrors` and it can have three values, the default `prompt`, `debugAnyway` and `showErrors`.

![prelaunch-choice](./images/1_39/prelaunch-choice.png)


## Contributions to extensions

### Java Extension

[Java 13](http://jdk.java.net/13/) is out and VS Code is ready for it. The latest [Java Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) now supports Java 13. Developers using Java 12 with preview features will need to upgrade to JDK 13 to keep working with them.

In addition, the Java language server adopted the [Deprecated Diagnostics Tag](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_37#_diagnosticstagdeprecated), which renders source code that references deprecated types or members with a strike-through line.

![Java deprecated method](images/1_39/java-deprecated-method.png)

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### TypeScript 3.7-beta support

Although VS Code will not bundle TypeScript 3.7 until its official release, we have already been working to support all the [exciting new TypeScript 3.7-beta features](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-7-beta/). This includes:

- Syntax highlighting of optional chaining and nullish coalescing in JavaScript and TypeScript files.
- Completion support for optional chaining.
- Control over semicolons with the new `javascript.format.insertSpaceAfterSemicolonInForStatements` and `typescript.format.insertSpaceAfterSemicolonInForStatements` settings.

You can easily try all these new TypeScript 3.7 features today by installing the [TypeScript nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next). Please share feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with the TypeScript 3.7 beta!

## Extension authoring

### Extension terminal API

The extension terminal API has been finalized, allowing an extension to react to terminal input and fully control its output. The following creates an extension terminal and prints hello world in red on start up:

```ts
const writeEmitter = new vscode.EventEmitter<string>();
const pty: vscode.Pseudoterminal = {
  onDidWrite: writeEmitter.event,
  open: () => writeEmitter.fire('\x1b[31mHello world\x1b[0m'),
  close: () => {}
};
vscode.window.createTerminal({ name: 'My terminal', pty });
```

See the [API reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api) and [the sample extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/extension-terminal-sample) for more details.

### Deprecation tags for symbols and completions

The symbol tag API that allows completion items and symbols to be marked as deprecated has been finalised. Learn more about it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38#_deprecation-tags-for-symbols-and-completions.

### Debug Session name is no longer readonly

It is possible to change the name of the `DebugSession`. The debug session's name is initially taken from the `DebugConfiguration`. Any changes will be properly reflected in the UI.

### Warning when creating webviews that don't use `Webview.asWebviewUri` for loading local resources

While developing an extension that uses the [Webview API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview), we now log a warning when you create a webview that loads local resources using `vscode-resource:` uris directly instead of using the new [`Webview.asWebviewUri` api](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38#_webviewaswebviewuri-and-webviewcspsource)

![Debug warning for a webview that uses vscode-resources](./images/1_39/webview-resource-warning.png)

Although old `vscode-resource:` uris will continue to work, we want all webview extensions to migrate to the `Webview.asWebviewUri` api as the new api:

- Handles some tricky edge cases around loading local resources from network drives.
- Makes it possible to have a webviews that can load a mix of local and remote content.
- Will work more reliably for web versions of VS Code.

### TreeView<T> message API

The API to set a message in a tree view has been finalized. You can see an example of how to use the message API in the [tree view extension sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/tree-view-sample).

## Language Server Protocol

The specification of the [3.15.0](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-15/) version of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-15/) is available. The version is not final yet so feedback is still welcome as an issue or a pull request in the Language Server Protocol [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol). Streaming and progress reporting support has been added to the next version of the language server protocol. Implementations for the node server and the VS Code client are available as `vscode-languageserver@6.0.0-next.1` and `vscode-languageclient@6.0.0-next.1` respectively.

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Cancellation support

A new `cancel` request has been added to the Debug Adapter Protocol that can give a hint to the debug adapter that the frontend client is no longer interested in the result produced for a specific request issued earlier.

This request has a hint characteristic: a debug adapter can only be expected to make a 'best effort' in honoring this request but there are no guarantees. A frontend client may only call this request if the capability `supportsCancelRequest` is defined and has the value of `true`.

The request that was canceled still needs to send a response back. This can either be a normal result or an error response. Returning partial results from a canceled request is possible but note that a frontend client has no generic way for detecting that a response is partial or not.

In the September release, VS Code supports cancellation for the `stacktrace`, `scopes`, and `variables` requests (used in the **CALL STACK** and **VARIABLES** views) and the `completions` requests (used in the Debug Console).

Note that as of September, only the [Mock Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andreweinand.mock-debug) extension implements cancellation.

### Finding possible breakpoints in a source range

The new `breakpointLocations` request can be used by a DAP client to find all possible breakpoint locations in a given source range. This can be used in the UI in order to improve the discoverability of "inline" ("column") breakpoints.

A client may only call the `breakpointLocations` request if the `supportsBreakpointLocationsRequest` capability is defined and has the value of `true`.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### vscode.env.uiKind

A new proposed API `vscode.env.uiKind` was added that allows an extension to figure out from what kind of UI the extension is being used from. In preparation for supporting running VS Code in a browser, the possible values are `UIKind.Desktop` and `UIKind.Web`.

### vscode.env.asExternalUri

The proposed `vscode.env.asExternalUri` API allows an extension to resolves an *external* uri — such as a `http:` or `https:` uri — from where the extension is running to a uri to the same resource on the client machine. This is a companion to the `vscode.env.openExternal` api, except instead of opening the resolved uri using an external program it returns the result to extensions.

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import * as http from 'http';

const PORT = 3000;

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  startLocalServer(PORT);

  context.subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand('example.command', async () => {
      const resolved = vscode.env.asExternalUri(vscode.Uri.parse(`http://localhost:${PORT}`));
      vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Resolved to: ${resolved} on client and copied to clipboard`);
      vscode.env.clipboard.writeText(resolved.toString());
  }));
}

function startLocalServer(port: number) {
  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end('Hello world!');
  });
  server.on('clientError', (err, socket) => {
    socket.end('HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\r\n\r\n');
  });
  server.listen(port);
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Started local server on port: ${port}`);
}
```

`vscode.env.asExternalUri` currently only supports `https:` and `http:` uris. It is a no-op if the extension is running on the client machine. However if the extension is running remotely, `vscode.env.asExternalUri` automatically establishes a port forwarding tunnel from the local machine to `target` on the remote and returns a local uri to the tunnel.

### Readonly webview editors for resources

You can find VS Code extensions for previewing everything from shaders to Excel files to 3D models. A few bold extensions have even built complex editor-style experiences for visually editing binary or xml files. While it's great that all this is already possible using VS Code's existing extension API, building a preview or custom editor currently requires cobbling together a bunch of APIs in non-intuitive ways. It also leave a lot up to extensions themselves, often resulting in user experiences that are not consistent with the rest of VS Code. The custom editor API proposal aims to improve this.

The custom editor API will provide a framework for extensions to create fully customizable read/write editors that are used in place of VS Code's standard text editor for specific resources. A XAML custom editor for example could show a WYSIWYG style editor for your `.xaml` files. Our end goal is to give extensions the most flexibility possible while keeping VS Code fast, lean, and consistent.

This iteration, we are sharing the first pieces of the custom editor API proposal: readonly, Webview based custom editors. Here's a quick overview of the currently proposed API:

#### Contributing a custom editor
A webview based custom editor binds a resource (a file) to a [webview](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview)) provided by an extension. This webview replaces VS Code's default text/binary editor for that resource.

Consider an extension that previews images. To create webview based editor, our extension first uses the proposed `webviewEditors` contribution point to tell VS Code about the custom editors it provides:

```json
"contributes": {
  "webviewEditors": [
    {
      "viewType": "myExtension.imagePreview",
      "displayName": "My Image Preview",
      "priority": "default",
      "selector": [
        {
          "filenamePattern": "*.{jpg,jpe,jpeg,png,bmp,gif,ico,tga,webp}",
          "mime": "image/*"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
},
"activationEvents": [
  "onWebviewEditor:myExtension.imagePreview"
]
```

The important properties are:

- `displayName` — Unique Identifier for the editor. This is also used in the extension code later. Note this identifier is also used for in the activation event.
- `displayName` — Human readable name of the custom editor.
- `priority` — Determines if the custom editor should be enabled by default.
- `selector`— Specifies when the editor should be enabled.
    - `filenamePattern` — A glob for which file names the editor should be enabled for
    - `mime` — A glob for which mime types the editor is enabled (this is used if you open a data uri resource, such as from git history)

The `"onWebviewEditor:myExtension.imagePreview"` [activationEvent](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/activation-events) ensures that our extension is activated whenever VS Code determines it should show our custom image preview editor.

We then use the proposed `registerWebviewEditorProvider` API to bind our `viewType` to a resolver that takes a resource and a webview editor. This resolve is invoked whenever a resource that matches the selector for the custom editor is opened:

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    context.subscriptions.push(vscode.window.registerWebviewEditorProvider(
        'myExtension.imagePreview',
        {
            async resolveWebviewEditor(resource: vscode.Uri, editor: vscode.WebviewEditor): Promise<void> {
                // Take ownership of webview and create its content
                editor.webview.html = `...`;
            }
        })
    );
}
```

That's it! At this point, our extension can use the `editor` just like a normal [webview](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview).

#### Custom editor UX

We've also added some proposed UX for managing custom editors.

The new `Reopen With` command allows you to change which editor is used for the current resource. This will close the existing editor and reopen it with the selected editor.

Additionally, the `workbench.experimental.editorAssociations` setting lets you control which custom editor is used for a given resource. It is a list of file selectors bound to the editor viewType that should be opened when a resource matches the selector:

```json
"workbench.experimental.editorAssociations": [
  {
    "filenamePattern": "*.png",
    "viewType": "myExtension.imagePreview",
  }
]
```

Note that `default` is also a valid `viewType` and can be used to force VS Code to open its normal text/binary editor instead of any default custom editor:

```json
"workbench.experimental.editorAssociations": [
  {
    "filenamePattern": "*.png",
    "viewType": "default",
  }
]
```

**Next Steps**
Custom editors are an exciting and potentially very powerful new extension point. We want to be sure we that we get the API right so that extensions can build new experiences without degrading VS Code's performance or deviating from some of our core UX principles.

The current proposal is only a first step and will likely be heavily revised. We will continue to iterate on the custom editor API over the coming months.

### TreeView<T> title

The tree view title is has always been taken from the extension package.json. Now, a tree view title is initially taken from the package.json and can be changed later. Changes to the title property will be properly reflected in the UI in the title of the view.

### startDebugging consoleMode option to merge debug consoles

In order to support hierarchical debug sessions better, we've added an optional argument `consoleMode` to the `vscode.debug.startDebugging` API. This argument controls if VS Code should merge the debug console of the parent and child debug sessions. For example, this is particularly useful for cluster debugging where there are many child sessions and the it is much cleaner if all the debug sessions go to the same debug console.

### Removed deprecated Terminal.onDidWriteData API

The `Terminal.onDidWriteData` proposed API has been removed in favor of the global event `window.onDidWriteTerminalData`.

## Engineering

### JavaScript minification via Terser

We changed the minifier used for minification of JavaScript for the product build to be [Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser). Previously we had been using an older version of `uglify-es`. The Terser developers have been very helpful supporting us during the adoption.

### Filewatcher update (Chokidar)

During this milestone we updated our file watcher for macOS and Linux to version `3.x`, which brings improved performance, reduced memory consumption, and a smaller package size. You can learn more from the [Chokidar repo](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) and [Chokidar 3 blog post](https://paulmillr.com/posts/chokidar-3-save-32tb-of-traffic/).

### Integration tests run against the real build now

Our product builds run a large integration test suite as part of the build. Previously these tests were executing against VS Code running out of sources. Now, these tests use the built version of VS Code to verify that the build is ready to be released.

### Building VS Code using TypeScript 3.6

VS Code core and the built-in extensions are now built using [TypeScript 3.6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-6/).
