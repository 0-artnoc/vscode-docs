## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.39 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[September iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80591)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### New title variable to indicate the remote name

A new variable was added that can be used for the `window.title` setting. Use `remoteName` to include the name of the remote you are connected to. See the [Remote Development overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) for more information about remote development with VS Code.

### Improved Trusted Domains setting

We simplified the management of trusted domains for the [outgoing link protection](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38#_link-protection-for-outgoing-links) feature introduced in the 1.38 release.

You can now use the command **Manage Trusted Domains** to easily add, remove, or modify trusted domains as a JSON text file.

![Improved trusted domains management](images/1_39/improved-trusted-domains-management.gif)

### Selectable completion details

Auto completion's details can now be selected for copy and paste.

![Selectable completion details](images/1_39/selectable-completion-details.gif)

### Updated Japanese UI font on Windows

On Windows, we have switched the Japanese UI typeface from `Meiryo` to `Yu Gothic UI` and `Meiryo UI`.

The `UI` typefaces save horizontal space by using narrower Japanese kana characters. You can use the Japanese UI by installing the [Japanese Language Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-CEINTL.vscode-language-pack-ja) and **Configure Display Language** to `ja`.

![Japanese typeface](images/1_39/japanese-typeface.png)

### Improved monospace typeface display in suggestions and hovers

Previously, the inline `<code>` segments in the suggestion and hover widgets didn't specify `font-family`. On Windows / macOS, these segments are rendered with Chrome's default choice for `font-family: monospace`.

In this iteration, we aligned them with the system sans-serif typefaces that is used throughout the VS Code UI.

* Windows: `Courier New` -> `Consolas` (To align with `Segoe UI`)
* macOS: `Courier` -> `SF Mono`, `Monaco`, `Menlo` (To align with `SF Text` and `Helvetica Neue`)
* Linux: No change. Inline code segments still rendered in `Liberation Mono`, which is Chrome's default for `font-family: monospace` on Linux.

![Suggest and Hover widgets monospace typeface](./images/1_39/suggest-hover-widgets-monospace-typeface.png)

### Validation for uniqueItems in the Settings editor

[Validation for string array settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38#_validation-for-string-array-settings), which was introduced in the 1.38 release, now supports `uniqueItems`.

If using `"uniqueItems": true`, duplicate entries in the Settings editor will show a warning.

### Code block highlighting in extension READMEs

Code blocks in extension READMEs are now highlighted in VS Code:

![A block of json code being highlighted](./images/1_39/extension-readme-highlighting.gif)

The highlighting uses the current [color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes).

### Image preview moved to a built-in extension

VS Code's image preview functionality has been moved out of the core codebase and into a built-in `Image Preview` extension. The functionality of image previews should be almost exactly the same as before.

![The built-in image preview extension](./images/1_39/image-preview-extension.png)

Extracting image preivew into a built-in extension makes it easier to fix bugs in it and add features, and will eventually also allow extensions to override VS Code's built-in image preview more easily.

This change was enabled by the [custom editor api](#readonly-custom-editors) work we completed this iteration.

## Integrated Terminal

### Automatic tunneling of localhost links in remote integrated terminals

When connected to [remote workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote), clicking `http` or `https` localhost links in the integrated terminal will now transparently open a tunnel so that your local machine can view resources from the remote machine. The gif below shows this behavior running the `http-server` utility in a remote SSH workspace.

![Tunneling when clicking on a localhost link in a remote terminal](./images/1_39/terminal-tunnel.gif)

Notice how when the link to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` is clicked, we open the local browser to `http://127.0.0.1:53507`. Behind the scenes, VS Code has automatically established a secure tunnel that connects port 53507 on the local machine to port 8080 on the remote.

## Languages

### CSS property completion with semicolon

CSS property completion now inserts a semicolon at the end of a line.

You can use this feature with `kbstyle(Ctrl+Enter)` (Windows / Linux) or `kbstyle(Cmd+Enter)` (macOS) to open new line without pushing the ending `;` to a new line.

You can control this feature with `[css|scss|less].completion.completePropertyWithSemicolon` setting.

![CSS property completion semicolon](./images/1_39/css-property-completion-semicolon.gif)

### CSS color swatch for variable completion

When completing CSS variables, if the original variable is a color string, VS Code now shows the completion item with its color:

![CSS color swatch variable](./images/1_39/css-color-swatch-variable.png)

### `markdown.links.openLocation`

The new `markdown.links.openLocation` setting controls where links within markdown files are opened. It has two values:

- `"currentGroup"` — (default) Opens links in the current editor group.
- `"beside"` — Open links to the side of the current markdown editor.

`"markdown.links.openLocation": "beside"` can be useful for working on documentation.

## Debugging

### Improved UI for column breakpoints

While debugging we now show all the breakpoint candidate locations inline. This makes it easier for the user to place a breakpoint on a more accurate position. To not clutter the UI too much we only show breakpoints candidate locations if there is more than 1 candidate at the line.

All the inline breakpoint decorations can now be interacted with, by clicking you can enable and disable them and you can also invoke the context menu for more actions.

![breakpoints](./images/1_39/breakpoints.gif)


Note that this feature requires specific support by an underlying runtime or debugger, and we expect only a few debug extensions to use this feature in the future. For this release, **Node Debug** and the **Debugger for Chrome** support this. As an example for other extensions our [Mock Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andreweinand.mock-debug) "mocks" support for this.

### Inline debug actions available in CALL STACK view

When there are sessions or threads shown in the CALL STACK view we show debug actions inline on hover.
This will make it easier to control the debug flow when debugging mulitple sessions or threads. Now it is no longer necessery to first focus a session or thread in order to perform an action on it.

If a session has only one thread then we show all the actions on the session since the thread is not displayed. Otherwise we show all the actions in their context (session actions on sessions and thread actions on threads).

![callstack](./images/1_39/callstack.gif)


### Improved CALL STACK view behavior

TODO@isidorn https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80004

Please subsume all thread/session/focus related improvements here

### Improved link detection in debug console

TODO@isidorn https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/27713

### PreLaunchTask can now refer to default build

TODO@isidorn, TODO@alexr00 https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/32239

With the introduction of a new variable `${defaultBuildTask}`, it is now possible to have a generic `preLaunchTask` that always refers to the default build task:

```json
{
    "name": "Hello World",
    "type": "node",
    "request": "launch",
    "preLaunchTask": "${defaultBuildTask}"
}
```

### Disable showing errors resulting from the "preLaunchTask"

TODO@isidorn https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/68084

## Contributions to extensions

### Java Extension

[Java 13](http://jdk.java.net/13/) is out and VS Code is ready for it. The latest [Java Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) now supports Java 13. Developers using Java 12 with preview features will need to upgrade to JDK 13 to keep working with them.

In addition, the Java language server adopted the [Deprecated Diagnostics Tag](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_37#_diagnosticstagdeprecated), which renders source code that references deprecated types or members with a strike-through line.

![Java deprecated method](images/1_39/java-deprecated-method.png)

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### TypeScript 3.7-beta support

Although VS Code will not bundle TypeScript 3.7 until its official release, we have already been working to support all the [exciting new TypeScript 3.7-beta features](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-7-beta/). This includes:

- Syntax highlighting of optional chaining and nullish coalescing in JavaScript and TypeScript files.
- Completion support for optional chaining.
- Control over semicolons with the new `javascript.format.insertSpaceAfterSemicolonInForStatements` and `typescript.format.insertSpaceAfterSemicolonInForStatements` settings.

You can easily try all these new TypeScript 3.7 features today by installing the [TypeScript nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next). Please share feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with the TypeScript 3.7 beta!

## Extension authoring

### Deprecation tags for symbols and completions

The symbol tag API that allows completion items and symbols to be marked as deprecated has been finalised. Learn more about it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38#_deprecation-tags-for-symbols-and-completions.

### New debug API for configuring output destination for multi-process debugging

TODO@isidorn https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/62419

### Warning when creating webviews that don't use `Webview.asWebviewUri` for loading local resources

While developing an extension that uses the [Webview API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview), we now log a warning when you create a webview that loads local resources using `vscode-resource:` uris directly instead of using the new [`Webview.asWebviewUri` api](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38#_webviewaswebviewuri-and-webviewcspsource)

![Debug warning for a webview that uses vscode-resources](images/1_38/webview-resource-warning.png)

Although old `vscode-resource:` uris will continue to work, we want all webview extensions to migrate to the `Webview.asWebviewUri` api as the new api:

- Handles some tricky edge cases around loading local resources from network drives.
- Makes it possible to have a webviews that can load a mix of local and remote content.
- Will work more reliably for web versions of VS Code.

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Cancellation support

A new `cancel` request has been added to the Debug Adapter Protocol that can give a hint to the debug adapter that the frontend client is no longer interested in the result produced for a specific request issued earlier.

This request has a hint characteristic: a debug adapter can only be expected to make a 'best effort' in honoring this request but there are no guarantees. A frontend client may only call this request if the capability `supportsCancelRequest` is defined and has the value of `true`.

The request that was canceled still needs to send a response back. This can either be a normal result or an error response. Returning partial results from a canceled request is possible but note that a frontend client has no generic way for detecting that a response is partial or not.

In the September release, VS Code supports cancellation for the `stacktrace`, `scopes`, and `variables` requests (used in the **CALL STACK** and **VARIABLES** views) and the `completions` requests (used in the Debug Console).

Note that as of September, only the [Mock Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andreweinand.mock-debug) extension implements cancellation.

### Finding possible breakpoints in a source range

The new `breakpointLocations` request can be used by a DAP client to find all possible breakpoint locations in a given source range. This can be used in the UI in order to improve the discoverability of "inline" ("column") breakpoints.

A client may only call the `breakpointLocations` request if the `supportsBreakpointLocationsRequest` capability is defined and has the value of `true`.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### vscode.env.uiKind

A new proposed API `vscode.env.uiKind` was added that allows an extension to figure out from what kind of UI the extension is being used from. In preparation for supporting running VS Code in a browser, the possible values are `UIKind.Desktop` and `UIKind.Web`.

### vscode.env.asExternalUri

The proposed `vscode.env.asExternalUri` API allows an extension to resolves an *external* uri — such as a `http:` or `https:` uri — from where the extension is running to a uri to the same resource on the client machine. This is a companion to the `vscode.env.openExternal` api, except instead of opening the resolved uri using an external program it returns the result to extensions.

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import * as http from 'http';

const PORT = 3000;

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  startLocalServer(PORT);

  context.subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand('example.command', async () => {
      const resolved = vscode.env.asExternalUri(vscode.Uri.parse(`http://localhost:${PORT}`));
      vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Resolved to: ${resolved} on client and copied to clipboard`);
      vscode.env.clipboard.writeText(resolved.toString());
  }));
}

function startLocalServer(port: number) {
  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end('Hello world!');
  });
  server.on('clientError', (err, socket) => {
    socket.end('HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\r\n\r\n');
  });
  server.listen(port);
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Started local server on port: ${port}`);
}
```

`vscode.env.asExternalUri` currently only supports `https:` and `http:` uris. It is a no-op if the extension is running on the client machine. However if the extension is running remotely, `vscode.env.asExternalUri` automatically establishes a port forwarding tunnel from the local machine to `target` on the remote and returns a local uri to the tunnel.

### Readonly custom editors

<!-- TODO @mjbvz -->

## Engineering

### JavaScript minification via Terser

We changed the minifier used for minification of JavaScript for the product build to be [Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser). Previously we had been using an older version of `uglify-es`. The Terser developers have been very helpful supporting us during the adoption.

### Filewatcher update (Chokidar)

During this milestone we updated our file watcher for macOS and Linux to version `3.x`, which brings improved performance, reduced memory consumption, and a smaller package size. You can learn more from the [Chokidar repo](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) and [Chokidar 3 blog post](https://paulmillr.com/posts/chokidar-3-save-32tb-of-traffic/).

### Integration tests run against the real build now

Our product builds run a large integration test suite as part of the build. Previously these tests were executing against VS Code running out of sources. Now, these tests use the built version of VS Code to verify that the build is ready to be released.

### Building VS Code using TypeScrpt 3.6

VS Code core and the built-in extensions are now built using [TypeScript 3.6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-6/).
