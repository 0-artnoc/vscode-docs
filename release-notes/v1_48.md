Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.48 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[July iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/102174)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22July+2020%22+is%3Aclosed+)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Browser support

### Text file encoding support

All of the text file encodings of the desktop version of VSCode are now supported for web as well.

As such, the settings `files.encoding` and `files.autoGuessEncoding` can be configured for web and work in the same way as they do on the desktop.


## Notable fixes

* [33720](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/33720): Wrong guess encoding as Windows 1252

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big *__Thank You__* to the following people who contributed this month to VS Code:
