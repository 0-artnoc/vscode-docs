## Browser support

### Text file encoding support

All of the text file encodings of the desktop version of VSCode are now supported for web as well.

As such, the settings `files.encoding` and `files.autoGuessEncoding` can be configured for web and work in the same way as they do on the desktop.

## Contributions to extensions

### Hex Editor
The [HexEditor extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.hexeditor) sees further improvements this iteration with support for copy and paste, file watching, and find and replace.
A full list of notable changes can be found in the [README](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-hexeditor/blob/master/README.md#release-notes). Any feedback or issues experienced can be filed against the [vscode-hexeditor repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-hexeditor/issues).
