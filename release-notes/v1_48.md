<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.48 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[July iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/102174)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22July+2020%22+is%3Aclosed+)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

This milestone, we again received helpful feedback from our community, which helped us identify and tackle [accessibility issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22June+2020%22+is%3Aclosed).

Highlight of this milestone was our work on improving the settings editor accessibility which is work in progress...

## Source Control

### Always show repositories

TODO@joao

TODO@joao (space opens in preview and keeps focus)

### Git: Overflow menu cleanup

TODO@joao

### Git API: Get remote sources command

### GitHub: Publish to a public repository

### GitHub: Automatic fork repository

## Debugging

### UX Improvements

We have changed the default value of `debug.openDebug` setting to be `openOnFirstSessionStart`. As a result the debug view will only be automatically opened when the first debug session is started.

We have updated the debug icon in the status bar to be aligned with the icon we use in the activity bar. This new icon should represent more clearly that the breakpoints will be respected when the program is started this way.

## Browser support

### Text file encoding support

All of the text file encodings of the desktop version of VSCode are now supported for web as well.

As such, the settings `files.encoding` and `files.autoGuessEncoding` can be configured for web and work in the same way as they do on the desktop.

## Contributions to extensions

### Hex Editor
The [HexEditor extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.hexeditor) sees further improvements this iteration with support for copy and paste, file watching, and find and replace.
A full list of notable changes can be found in the [README](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-hexeditor/blob/master/README.md#release-notes). Any feedback or issues experienced can be filed against the [vscode-hexeditor repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-hexeditor/issues).

#### Copy and Paste Support
The ability to copy values to your clipboard and paste them either inisder the editor or into whatever other source you wish has been added.

#### Find and Replace Support
The hex editor now comes with a similar find and replace widget to that found within VS Code. It suuports searching hex fields using wildcards (i.e FF ?? DD) and regex searching on the decoded text section.

#### Multi Select
The addition of drag and drop selection, shift and ctrl click selection, and holding shift and navigating with the keyboard to create a selection has bee added.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Submenus
