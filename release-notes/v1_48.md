# July 2020 (version 1.48)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.48 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[July iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/102174)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22July+2020%22+is%3Aclosed+)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Accessibility

This milestone, we again received helpful feedback from our community, which helped us identify and tackle [accessibility issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22June+2020%22+is%3Aclosed).

The highlight of this milestone was our work on improving the settings editor accessibility, which is still a work in progress.

## Workbench

### Search Editor

We added an "Open Search Editor" command to open an existing search editor if one exists, or otherwise create a new one. The pre-existing command "Open new Search Editor" has been renamed to "New Search Editor", and will always create a new search editor.

Thanks to [a community PR](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/103627), search editors now support custom `search.sortOrder` configurations, such as sorting by file type, modified date, or result count.

### Extensions: Overflow menu cleanup

Extensions filter actions are moved under to a separate filter action:

![Extensions filter menu](images/1_48/extensions-filter-menu.png)

*Theme: GitHub Light*

Extensions `...` menu has been refactored for better organization of extensions views and other actions:

![Extensions overflow menu](images/1_48/extensions-overflow-menu.png)

*Theme: GitHub Light*

## Source Control

### Always show repositories

There's a new setting, `scm.alwaysShowRepositories`, that makes the Source Control view always show the repository rows, even if there's only a single repository open:

![Always show repositories](images/1_48/scm-always-show-repositories.gif)

### Better keyboard navigation

As you navigate the Source Control view, pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> on a change will now open it as a preview editor and keep the focus in the Source Control view, for easier keyboard navigation.

### Git: Overflow menu cleanup

Thanks to the new submenu proposed API, the Git `...` menu has been refactored for better organization of several commands:

![Git menu with submenus](images/1_48/git-submenus.png)

### Git API: Get remote sources command

The Git extension now exposes a new extension API command to show a remote source Quick Pick interface: `git.api.getRemoteSources`. Read more about this in [issue #102394](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/102394#issuecomment-658195488).

### GitHub: Publish to a public repository

When publishing a repository to GitHub, you now have the choice between making the repository public or private:

![Publish public repo](images/1_48/github-publish-public.png)

### GitHub: Automatic fork repository

## Debugging

### UX improvements

* The default value of the `debug.openDebug` setting has been changed to `openOnFirstSessionStart`. As a result, the Debug view will only be automatically opened when the first debug session is started.

* We have updated the debug icon in the Status bar to be better aligned with the icon we use in the Activity bar. This new icon should represent more clearly that the breakpoints will be respected when the program is started this way.

  ![Debug status new icon](images/1_48/debug-status.png)

## Browser support

### Text file encoding support

All of the text file encodings of the desktop version of VS Code are now also supported when running in a browser.

![Web encoding](images/1_48/web-encoding.gif)

As such, the settings `files.encoding` and `files.autoGuessEncoding` can be now configured for web and work, in the same way as in the desktop version.

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Settings Sync

Settings Sync is now available for preview in the stable release ðŸŽ‰. Refer to the [user guide](https://aka.ms/vscode-settings-sync-help) for more information & FAQs.

Feature is now called **Settings Sync** also in the product. All of its references & settings are renamed to be aligned.

![Settings Sync](images/1_48/settings-sync.png)

*Theme: GitHub Light*

**Manual Merge**

In this milestone we made turning on settings sync flow much smoother by introducing the manual merge feature:

![Settings Sync Manual Merge](images/1_48/settings-sync-manual-merge.gif)

**Settings Sync Insiders Service**

We added a new settings sync insiders service for VS Code insiders separating from VS Code stable. You can always sync your insiders with stable using `Settings Sync: Select Service...` command which is available only in VS Code insiders.

## Contributions to extensions

### Hex Editor

The [HexEditor extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.hexeditor) sees further improvements this iteration with support for copy and paste, file watching, and find and replace. A full list of notable changes can be found in the [README](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-hexeditor/blob/master/README.md#release-notes). Any feedback or issues experienced can be filed against the [vscode-hexeditor repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-hexeditor/issues).

**Copy and Paste Support**

We've added the ability to copy values to your clipboard and paste them either inside the editor, or into whatever other source you wish.

![Copy and Paste](images/1_48/hex-copy-paste.gif)

**Find and Replace Support**

The hex editor now comes with a similar find and replace widget to the  one found within VS Code. It supports searching hexadecimal fields using wildcards (for example, `FF ?? DD`) and regex searching on the decoded text section.

![Find and Replace](images/1_48/hex-find-replace.gif)

**Multi Select**

You can now use drag and drop selection, shift and ctrl click selection, and holding shift and navigating with the keyboard to create a selection.

![Multi Select](images/1_48/hex-selection.gif)

### Remote Development

Work continues on the [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), which allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/master/remote-release-notes/v1_48.md).


### Notebooks

The VS Code team is continuing work on native support for Notebooks. To help with development, we've created a [GitHub Issue Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-github-issue-notebooks) extension, which lets you search GitHub issues and pull requests. This extension is still in preview and requires using VS Code [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders), but it lets you experience Notebooks first hand, and we welcome your feedback.

**Notebook UX**

We continue to tweak the general UX of Notebooks. This month we made cells even more compact and added a `...` menu to the toolbar to make cell-related actions even easier to find.

![Cell menu](images/1_48/notebook-ux.png)

**Drag and drop enhancement**

We improved the experience of drag and drop in Notebooks. Dragging a collapsed markdown cell will move all nested cells inside the folding region.

![Drag grouped cells](images/1_48/notebook-dnd-grouped-cells.gif)

**Reopen with editor**

You can now reopen the Notebook document in the text editor, or any other available editor types directly from the context menu of the editor title.

![Reopen with](images/1_48/notebook-reopen-with.gif)

**Collapsing cells and outputs**

You can now collapse cell outputs and inputs, which is useful when you want to clean up your Notebook view to focus on other parts of it.

![Collapse cells](images/1_48/cell-collapse.gif)

## Language Server Index Format

The TypeScript LSIF generator added support for multi project setups. In addition, memory consumption was optimized, especially around symbols exported via explicit export statements.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Submenus

The menu API has been extended to support submenus. This has already been adopted by the Git extension to clean its overflow menu. Check out the [syntax](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/100172#issuecomment-645203070) as well as the [possibilities](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/102784#issuecomment-663036534) that this API enables.

![Git menu](images/1_48/git-submenus.png)

### Stopping debug sessions

VS Code uses the function `vscode.debug.startDebugging` for starting debug sessions. In this milestone, we introduced the matching function `vscode.debug.stopDebugging` to stop a specific session (or all sessions). With this new API, it is no longer necessary to use the less predictable **Debug: Stop** command (command ID: `workbench.action.debug.stop`) which only stops the "active" debug session.

## Documentation and extensions

### New Remote Container topics

There are new topics for working with Containers in VS Code:

* [Attach to Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/attach-container) - Attach to an already running Docker Container.
* [Create a Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) - Create a custom container matching your development environment.
* [devcontainer.json reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference) - Control container creation through `devcontainer.json` properties.

And check out this blog post on using [Dev Containers in Education](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2020/07/27/containers-edu) to help educators and students create stable, reproducible classroom setups.

### Java lightweight mode

The [Language Support for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) extension now supports a lightweight mode, for when you want to quickly review and navigate your Java source files without creating or opening a Java project. You'll still get powerful language features such as code navigation, outlining, and syntax checking for your source code, as well as the JDK.

### Azure Cache extension

The new [Azure Cache](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azurecache.vscode-azurecache) extension makes it easy to browse through data in your [Azure Caches](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache).

## Notable fixes

* [33720](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/33720): Wrong guess encoding as Windows 1252
* [102037](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/102037): If a debug adapter fails to send a `terminated` event, VS Code gets stuck in debug mode
* [103463](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/103463): When docked, the "disconnect" and "stop" icons in the debug toolbar don't update properly
