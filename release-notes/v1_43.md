# February 2020 (version 1.43)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.43 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/90371)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Search editors

After a few iterations stabilizing on [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/), we are shipping Search editors, which let you view workspace search results in a full-sized editor tab, complete with syntax highlighting and optional lines of surrounding context. This had been a [highly requested feature](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/23931) for some time.

![Search editor](images/1_43/search-editor-overview.png)
*Theme: [A Touch of Lilac](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexnho.a-touch-of-lilac-theme), Font: [Hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig/)*

In a Search editor, results can be navigated to using **Go to Definition** actions, such as `kb(editor.action.revealDefinition)` to open the source location in the current editor group, or `kb(editor.action.revealDefinitionAside)` to open the location in an editor to the side. Additionally, double-clicking can optionally open the source location, configurable with the `search.searchEditor.doubleClickBehaviour` setting.

![Search editor definition reveals](images/1_43/search-editor-triggers.gif)

You can open a new search editor with the **Search Editor: Open New Search Editor** command, or using the **Open New Search Editor** button at the top of the Search view. Alternatively, you can copy your existing results from a Search view over to a Search editor with the **Open in Editor** link added to the top of the results tree, or the **Search Editor: Open Results in Editor** command.

**Note**: You can try out the experimental [Search Editor: Apply Changes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jakearl.search-editor-apply-changes) extension to synchronize edits you make in a Search editor back to source files:

![Search Editor: Apply Changes extension](images/1_43/search-editor-apply.gif)

### Progress notifications

Notifications that indicate a long running operation behave slightly differently starting with this release:

* They do not provide a generic **Close** button anymore as it gave the wrong impression about the operation being canceled or not (you can still press the `kbstyle(Esc)` key to hide them).
* The notifications indicate the progress of their operation in the Status bar whenever the notification is hidden while the operation is still ongoing.

The latter change helps to understand that an operation is continuing to run in the background (such as a long running save operation) after you have dismissed the notification.

![Progress Notification](images/1_43/progress-notification.gif)

*Theme: [Dracula Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula), Font: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)*

### Notarized macOS Builds

Visual Studio Code for macOS is finally notarized, so you should no longer see the following dialog:

![macOS missing notarization warning](images/1_43/notarization.jpg)

Read the [investigation issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74782) and [Apple's developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution) for more details.

### Untitled editors

A new setting `workbench.editor.untitled.labelFormat` lets you control whether untitled editors should use the file contents as the title or not. Possible values are `content` or `name`. Configure `'workbench.editor.untitled.labelFormat': 'name'` for the previous behavior, where untitled editors would have a short title, such as **Untitled-1**.

When pasting text into an untitled editor, VS Code now automatically tries to detect the language mode from the first line of text. For example, pasting XML will set the XML mode automatically upon paste if the first line contains the typical XML header `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`.

### Open workspaces via application links

VS Code supports opening files through protocol links (for example `vscode://file/<file-path>`). In this milestone, we've expanded support to include opening folders or workspaces.

The syntax is the same:

```bash
vscode://file/<path>
vscode-insiders://file/<path>
```

### Draggable sash corners

Did you know you could resize two orthogonal sashes simultaneously by grabbing and dragging the intersection between them? This already worked for editor sashes, and now it also works in the edges between editors and views:

![Draggable sash corners](images/1_43/sash-corners.gif)

*Theme: [GitHub Sharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme), Font: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)*

### Welcome views

Welcome views are a new addition to the workbench, which generalizes the capability of every view to create experiences for driving users to create content or configure VS Code, whenever there isn't any meaningful content to be displayed. Some views have already adopted this infrastructure, for example, the File Explorer.

![File Explorer Welcome view](images/1_43/explorer.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Sharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme)*

### Source Control welcome view

Thanks to the new welcome view infrastructure, the Source Control view now provides a better experience out of the box for certain temporary situations, in which it would otherwise appear empty. For example, it can now guide users to open folders or clone repositories when there isn't a folder open; or it can also guide users to install Git, when no installation is detected.

![Source Control Welcome view](images/1_43/scm.png)

*Theme: [GitHub Sharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme)*

## Accessibility

### Linux screen reader support

With the help of the community, we have focused on making VS Code accessible on Linux with Orca screen reader. Orca and Chromium are still actively working on Screen Reader support, so there are a couple of things needed in order to have this fully working:

* Make sure to use the latest version of Orca out of master. Instructions can be found in [issue #91063](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/91063).
* Make sure to have the setting `"editor.accessibilitySupport": "on"` in VS Code. You can do this using settings, or by running the **Show Accessibility Help** command and pressing `kbstyle(Ctrl+E)` to turn on accessibilitySupport.

After enabling that setting, VS Code should work with the Orca screen reader.

## Editor

### Definition links in Peek

There is now more control over the behavior of the **Go to Definition** mouse gesture. By default, **Go to Definition** via mouse opens a separate editor but with the new setting `editor.definitionLinkOpensInPeek`, the gesture will open in a Peek view.

![Definition with mouse in Peek](images/1_43/def_link_peek.gif)

### Folding

There's a new setting that controls what happens when you click in the empty space to the right of a folded line (after the `...`):

`"editor.unfoldOnClickAfterEndOfLine": true`.

By default, the setting is turned off.

### Default render whitespace setting

The default value of the `editor.renderWhitespace` setting has changed from `none` to `selection`. Whitespace characters will now be rendered on highlighted text by default.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.8.3

VS Code now bundles TypeScript 3.8.3. This [major update](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8/) brings support for new language features including [ECMAScript private fields](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8/#ecmascript-private-fields), [top-level await](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8/#top-level-await) expressions, and the [export * as ns](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8/#export-star-as-namespace-syntax) syntax, along with many tooling features and improvements. The update also fixes a number of important bugs.

You can read more about TypeScript 3.8 on the [TypeScript blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-8/#export-star-as-namespace-syntax).

### TypeScript semantic highlighting

Semantic highlighting is now on per default for TypeScript and JavaScript. Semantic highlighting is provided by the TypeScript language server and goes on top of the syntax highlighting based on TextMate grammars. The default syntax (TextMate) highlighter classifies many tokens as `variables` and these are now resolved into namespaces, classes, parameters, and so on.

Semantic highlighting is controlled by the following setting:

```json
"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": true
```

### Convert to template string refactoring

You can use the new **Convert to template string** refactoring for JavaScript and TypeScript to quickly convert string concatenations to [template strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals):

![Converting string concatenation to a template string](images/1_43/ts-convert-to-template-string.gif)

### Call hierarchy support for JavaScript and TypeScript

TypeScript 3.8 brings [call hierarchy](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_33#_call-hierarchy) support in JavaScript and TypeScript.

![Viewing incoming calls using call hierarchy in a TypeScript file](images/1_43/ts-call-hierarchy.png)

### Support for http(s) @link JSDoc inline tags

Our IntelliSense now renders [JS Doc @link inline tags](https://jsdoc.app/tags-inline-link.html) for http and https links. In the example image below, notice how the `@link` for `lightbulb menu` is rendered in the hover:

![A hover with a rendered @link jsdoc tag](images/1_43/ts-jsdoc-link.png)

`@link` to URLs work for both JavaScript and TypeScript and are rendered as clickable links in hovers, suggestion details, and signature help.

### JSON schemas

When associating file names to schemas, you can now also use exclusion patterns. Exclusion patterns start with '!'. To match, at least one pattern needs to match and the last matching pattern must not be an exclusion pattern.

```json
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": [
        "/receipts/*.json",
        "!/receipts/*.excluded.json"
      ],
      "url": "./receipts.schema.json"
    }
  ]
```

There were multiple fixes for SCSS and LESS

## Debugging

### Run and Debug renamed to Run

We have renamed the **Run and Debug** view to just **Run**. We wanted to simplify the name and to make it easier for new users to run their applications. Debuggers can be used to run apps when no breakpoints are set or when using the **Run Without Debugging** command. We have also renamed the main menu entry from **Debug** to **Run**. To align with the new names, we have also updated the Activity Bar icon. It is now a play button with a bug decoration to emphasize that the view can be used both for running and debugging.

![Run and Debug Activity Bar icon](images/1_43/run.png)

### Debug Console grouping

We now support debug console grouping in VS Code. Debug extensions can let VS Code know when to group debug console output together under a common parent. For now the Mock Debug extension supports the console grouping debug protocol but soon other debug extensions will support it as well - most notably the JavaScript debugger.

![Debug Console grouping](images/1_43/debug-console.png)

### Disable Debug Console history suggestions

You can now turn off history suggestions in the Debug Console via a new `debug.console.historySuggestions` setting. By default history suggestions are **on**.

## Integrated Terminal

### Unicode 11 support

The width of characters in the terminal now default to the unicode 11 widths. What this means to most people is that emojis will be correctly showing up as wide characters.

![Emojis are correctly wide chars](images/1_43/unicode11.png)

### Better Alt+Click to navigate prompt support

The terminal has a feature that lets you `Alt+Click` on a cell and the cursor will navigate to that cell. Historically when in a shell's prompt, this only worked on a single line, even if it was wrapped. This has been improved to work on a full wrapped line.

![Alt+Click can move across wrapped lines](images/1_43/altclick.gif)
*Theme: [Sapphire](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire)*

Note that this may not work correctly on Windows yet but [recent changes to ConPTY](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/405) should improve this in the future.

## Tasks

### Task Quick Pick updates

The task quick pick, shown when the **Run Task** command is executed, has been updated to show you which task providers are still running. If you don't need tasks from that provider, the **Stop Detecting** button will immediately show you the tasks that have been detected so far so you don't have to wait for any slow task providers.

![Tasks Stop Detecting](images/1_43/tasks_stop_detecting.gif)
*Theme: [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme), Font: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)*

### Task instance limit

The tasks `"runOptions"` now includes an `"instanceLimit"`, which specifies the number of instances of a task that are permitted. The default `"instanceLimit"` is 1.

### promptString password input

The `"promptString"` user input type can have `"password": true`, which will causes the dropdown input box to obscure the typed content like a password.

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Settings Sync

We have been working the last couple of months to support synchronizing VS Code preferences (settings) across machines (popular feature request [#2743](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/2743)). In this milestone, we are happy to announce that this feature is ready for preview in our [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) release. You can now have your preferences synchronized in all your VS Code installs across all your machines. You can also bootstrap VS Code with your personal preferences on a fresh machine with minimal effort. Following video demonstrates this:

![Bootstrap VS Code using Settings Sync](images/1_43/settings-sync-import.gif)

Currently only Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, Extensions, and the Display Language are synchronized but we are planning to add more. You can review our list of proposed [Setting Sync features](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asettings-sync+label%3Afeature-request).

Machine settings (with `machine` or `machine-overridable` scopes) are not synchronized by default. You can also add or remove settings you want to this list from Settings editor or using the setting `sync.ignoredSettings`.

![Ignored settings](images/1_43/settings-sync-ignored-settings.png)
*Theme: GitHub Sharp*

Keyboard Shortcuts are synchronized per platform by default. If your keyboard shortcuts are platform-agnostic, you can synchronize them across platforms by disabling the setting `sync.keybindingsPerPlatform`.

All built-in and installed extensions are synchronized along with their global enablement state. You can skip synchronizing an extension, either from the Extensions view or using the setting `sync.ignoredExtensions`.

![Ignored extensions](images/1_43/settings-sync-ignored-extensions.png)
*Theme: GitHub Sharp*

Settings Sync supports detecting conflicts in settings and keybindings while synchronizing. Conflicts are shown using the diff editor with incoming (remote) changes on the left side and local changes on the right side. You can resolve the conflicts by editing in the right side editor and merge the changes using the actions provided in the editor.

![Settings Sync handling conflicts](images/1_43/settings-sync-conflicts.gif)
*Themes: GitHub Sharp, GitHub Sharp Dark*

Settings Sync activity can be monitored in the **Log (Sync)** output view. All local preferences are backed up for last 30 days (atleast 10) in the disk whenever they are changed during synchronization. You can use the command **Sync: Open Local Backups Folder** to go the backups location and retain your old preferences.

![Settings Sync log](images/1_43/settings-sync-log.png)
*Theme: GitHub Sharp*

At any time, you can turn off synchronization either on your current VS Code instance or on all your VS Code installs. When choosing to disable all synchronization, your data will be removed from the cloud.

![Turn off Settings Sync](images/1_43/settings-sync-turnoff.gif)

Settings Sync uses a Microsoft account to store your VS Code preferences for synchronization and therefore you would need an account to use this. Refer to the [Settings Sync documentation](https://aka.ms/vscode-settings-sync-help) for more information and help.

### New JavaScript debugger

This month we've continued making progress on our new JavaScript debugger. It's installed by default on Insiders, and can be installed [from the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-debug-nightly) in VS Code Stable. You can start using it with your existing launch configurations by enabling the `debug.javascript.usePreview` setting. Here are some new features we added this month:

**Pretty Printing**

![Animation of VS Code asking whether to pretty-print a minified file when the debugger steps into it. Clicking "yes" formats the file and moves the debugger into the new beautified code.](images/1_43/js-debug-pretty-printing.gif)

*Theme: Earthsong, Font: Fira Code*

The debugger can now pretty-print files, especially useful when dealing with minified sources. It will show a prompt when you step into or open a file that looks minified, and you can also trigger pretty-printing manually via the **Debug: Pretty print for debugging** command.

You can turn off the suggestion prompt by clicking "Never", or changing the setting `debug.javascript.suggestPrettyPrinting` to `false`.

**Support for Edge and WebView2**

We now support launching the [new Edge browser](https://www.microsoft.com/edge), just change your debug type from `chrome` or `pwa-chrome` to `pwa-msedge` to try it out. It supports all the same configuration settings as `chrome` does.

With this comes support for the [WebView2](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/hosting/webview2) control in desktop Windows applications. Take a look at our [webview demo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/tree/master/demos/webview) to see how to set this up.

![Image showing the debugger paused at a breakpoint for code running in a native window's WebView.](images/1_43/js-debug-webview.png)

**Remote Debugging**

You can now debug browser code from a remote workspace--like [VS Online](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-online/) or [remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh)--in the new debugger. To set this up, port forward your web server (or a use a [simple static web server](https://github.com/zeit/serve/blob/master/README.md)), and then create a `chrome` or `pwa-msedge` launch configuration that points to the forwarded port. For example:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "pwa-msedge",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug my App",
      "url": "http://localhost:5000", // <- debug an app forwarded on port 5000
    }
  ]
}
```

When you start it, a browser will open on your machine and you can debug like you normally would from the comfort of VS Code.

### Easier moving of even more views

Last release, we had just a taste of relocating views to the panel. In this release, this experience has been expanded to many more views. You can now move many more views such as the Debug/Run views or the new Timeline view. You can also now move them into other view in the sidebar. For example, perhaps you'd like to move the **Open Editors** view into the Source Control view. You can do all of this by dragging the views and dropping them in the desired location in the Activity Bar or Panel. The animation below highlights a few examples.

![Moving views around](images/1_43/moving-views-around.gif)

*Theme: [Horizon Bright](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jolaleye.horizon-theme-vscode), Font: [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)*

We've also introduced a new command to make moving views easier with the keyboard: **View: Move Focused View** (`workbench.action.moveFocusedView`).

And finally, this is a preview feature. So, in case you get into a state that you can't fix, there is a command to reset all views to their original locations: **View: Reset View Locations** (`workbench.action.resetViewLocations`).

## Contributions to extensions

### Remote Development

Work continues on the [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), which allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Feature highlights in 1.43 include:

* Open remote workspaces via application links.
* Remote - SSH: Support for Windows and macOS SSH hosts.
* Remote - SSH: Connection sharing on by default.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/master/remote-release-notes/v1_43.md).

## Extension authoring

### Debugger Extension API

**Debug Welcome view**

As specified in the Welcome View Content API section, the `debug` view is now open for Welcome View Content contributions. These can be used to guide beginning users to specific features that simplify running or debugging programs.

In order for the view to not become cluttered by too many Welcome View Content contributions, we suggest that individual contributions are only enabled for the current active language. To facilitate this, we have introduced a new context key `debugStartLanguage`, which is set to the last active editor language for which a debugger was used.

For example, if your debugger targets Python, you would contribute Welcome View Content only if `debugStartLanguage == "python"`. In case your debugger targets multiple languages, you can use the OR operator to combine multiple conditions.

**New Debug Hover API**

Today VS Code's debug hover uses a regular expression based heuristic to find an expression under the mouse that the VS Code debugger evaluates via a debugger and then shows the result in a hover. Since the regular expression is not configurable, not all languages are handled correctly (or they are not handled to the full extent possible). See [#84044](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/84044#issuecomment-576777272), [#89603](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/89603), or [#89332](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/89332) for typical problems.

In this milestone, we've introduced new extension API to control the behavior of the debug hover.

An `EvaluatableExpressionProvider` can be registered for a language to provide an expression under the mouse that the VS Code debugger will evaluate against an active debug session.

Here is a simple example from the [Mock debug](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug) sample that shows a (naive) implementation based on `getWordRangeAtPosition` API:

```ts
vscode.languages.registerEvaluatableExpressionProvider('markdown', {
  provideEvaluatableExpression(document: vscode.TextDocument, position: vscode.Position):
                              vscode.ProviderResult<vscode.EvaluatableExpression> {
    const wordRange = document.getWordRangeAtPosition(position);
    if (wordRange) {
      return new vscode.EvaluatableExpression(wordRange);
    }
    return undefined; // nothing evaluatable found under mouse
  }
});
```

**No longer escaping whitespace**

The VS Code debugger UI no longer escapes or quotes any whitespace received from a debug extension or debug adapter. For example, all strings received in DAP Variables or as DAP Output events are shown in the UI as they are without modification.

This means that it is now up to the debug extension or debug adapter to decide if whitespace needs to be escaped before sending the data to VS Code. More details can be found in [issue #73845](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/73845).

### CodeAction.disabled

With the `CodeAction.disabled` property, extension can now tell VS Code why a given `CodeAction` is not possible for the user's current selection. This is especially useful for [refactorings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring).

Here's an example of using `.disabled` in our [Code Action sample extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/code-actions-sample).

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export class Emojizer implements vscode.CodeActionProvider {

    public provideCodeActions(document: vscode.TextDocument, range: vscode.Range): vscode.CodeAction[] | undefined {
        const action = new vscode.CodeAction(`Convert to ${emoji}`, vscode.CodeActionKind.Refactor.append('emojize'));

        if (!this.isAtStartOfSmiley(document, range)) {
            // Tell the user why our action is not available
            action.disabled = { reason: 'Selection is not currently on a :)' };
            return [action];
        }

        action.edit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();
        action.edit.replace(document.uri, new vscode.Range(range.start, range.start.translate(0, 2)), '😀');
        return action;
    }
}
```

If the user tries to apply a disabled Code Action [through a keybinding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_custom-keybindings-for-refactorings), VS Code will display the `.disabled` error message to the user:

![Showing the '.disabled' error in the editor](images/1_41/code-action-disabled-error.png)

In addition, to help with discoverability, disabled Code Actions are shown as faded in the **Refactor** and **Source Action** context menus:

![A '.disabled' Code Action in the Refactor menu](images/1_41/code-action-disabled-faded.png)

Note that disabled actions are not shown in the top-level lightbulb menu.

### Terminal.exitStatus

Extensions can now determine whether terminals have exited and if they did, which exit code was used (if any).

```ts
window.onDidCloseTerminal(t => {
  if (t.exitStatus && t.exitStatus.code) {
    vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Exit code: ${t.exitStatus.code}`);
  }
});
```

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Support grouping in output events

An optional `group` attribute has been added to the `output` event in order to keep an output log organized by grouping related messages. Possible values for `group` are `start` and `startCollapsed` to open a group either expanded or collapsed, and `end` for closing a group.

**Note:** Starting with this release, VS Code supports this DAP enhancement.

### Allow cursor placement via completion items

Optional `selectionStart` and `selectionLength` attributes have been added to the completion item. With these attributes, the client's current selection (or caret position) can be controlled after the completion text has been inserted.

**Note:** VS Code does not yet support this DAP enhancement. It is planned for the next release.

### Proposal: Progress events

We made some progress on a proposal for adding **progress events** to the Debug Adapter Protocol. If you are interested, you can contribute to the discussion on this [DAP feature request](https://github.com/microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/92).

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Custom Editor API

<!--   mjbvz -->

### Workspace Edit Metadata

We have finalized the `WorkspaceEditEntryMetadata` API. It allows extension authors to classify changes of a workspace edit, in particular if a change needs to be reviewed before being applied.

### CodeActionProviderMetadata.documentation

We've revised [our previous proposal](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_42#_documentationrefactoring-contribution-point) about standardizing how extensions contribute documentation for their Code Actions. With the updated proposal, documentation is now provided using a `documentation` property on the `CodeActionProviderMetadata` type.

For example, here's how our built-in JavaScript and TypeScript extension contributes documentation:

```ts
class TypeScriptRefactorProvider implements vscode.CodeActionProvider {

	public static readonly metadata: vscode.CodeActionProviderMetadata = {
		providedCodeActionKinds: [ vscode.CodeActionKind.Refactor ],
		documentation: [
			{
				kind: vscode.CodeActionKind.Refactor,

        // This command opens a webpage when executed
				command: {
					command: LearnMoreAboutRefactoringsCommand.id,
					title: localize('refactor.documentation.title', "Learn more about JS/TS refactorings")
				}
			}
		]
	};

  ...
}
```

The documentation is rendered after the main Code Action list, whenever the user request refactorings:

![The JS/TS Code Action documentation entry](images/1_43/code-action-documentation.png)

[Issue #86788](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/86788) tracks the status of the proposal.

### Welcome View Content API

Certain views now support welcome content contributed from extensions. See the [original issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/89080) for more information.

The views that have adopted this API are:

* `explorer` - File Explorer
* `scm` - Source Control
* `debug` - Run/Debug

As an example, here's a welcome view content contribution from the Git extension, on the `explorer` welcome view:

### OpenDialogOptions and SaveDialogOptions title

The `OpenDialogOptions` and `SaveDialogOptions` both have a proposed `title` property. Whether the `title` is shown is platform-dependent, but if the platform does show the `title`, it is shown above the Save or Open dialog. For example, the built-in command **Workspaces: Save Workspace As...** sets the title to **Save Workspace**.

### Electron 7.0 Update

In this milestone, we finished the exploration of bundling Electron 7 into VS Code. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chromium 78.0.3904.130 and Node.js 12.8.1.

#### For HDR displays

We are tracking an issue from users with HDR displays https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/88491 that VS Code looks dull and unsuable. This is an issue with all chromium based applications on 78.0.3904.130 and the issue is fixed in more recent version of Chromium 81, VS Code will get this fix once we upgrade to Electron 9 and there are technical reasons on why the fix couldn't be backported to Chromium 78. While the upgrade might take some time, we have a temporary workaround for this issue.

* Open the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`).
* Run the **Preferences: Configure Runtime Arguments** command.
* This command will open a `argv.json` file to configure runtime arguments. You might see some default arguments there already.
* Edit `"disable-color-correct-rendering": true` to `"disable-color-correct-rendering": false`.
* Restart VS Code.

**Note:** Do not edit this setting unless you are seeing issues!

We added this default runtime argument so that we can override chromium's default color correction to sRGB and instead use the display color space on macOS to avoid issues like https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/84154 but this doesn't work for HDR displays.

### `"strict": true`

When we first released VS Code, TypeScript was still a new and rapidly evolving language that was missing some of the useful type safety checks that you probably take for granted today, such as [strict null checking](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#--strictnullchecks). Over the past few years, the TypeScript team has introduced a number of options that make the TypeScript compiler more "strict". These strict options can catch many common programming mistakes and eliminate entire classes of errors. The benefits of strict mode are well documented, and we've long wanted to enable strict mode for VS Code too. However doing so seemed like an almost impossible task given that it would require fixing many thousands of errors in the half a million or so lines of code that make up the core VS Code codebase.

Still, the value of strict mode was great enough that we decided it was worth working towards enabling it, even if it would take us some time to get there. So over the past two years or so, we've been incrementally updating our code base to be strict mode compliant. We did all this work incrementally and directly in our development branch so that every strict mode related fix made our codebase a little bit safer for everyone. Enabling strict null checks was probably the most complicated part of the process, and we documented how we accomplished this in a [blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/05/23/strict-null).

This iteration, we finally finished up with enabling the last strict mode option: `strictFunctionTypes`. With this done, a [rather anticlimactic commit](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/2158e77627d56d463314f003242e763b3da6b62b) then enabled strict mode for our entire codebase!

Enabling strict mode was a long journey that everyone on the core VS Code team and many community members contributed to. However, by doing this work incrementally, we were able to benefit from all this hard work starting on day one. Going forward, strict mode should encourage coding best practices, make refactoring safer, and ultimately let us ship faster and with fewer bugs!

### Improved build performance

VS Code uses [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/) for its continuous integration builds and recently the build performance was improved considerably. You can learn more about this in the [Improving CI Build Times
](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2020/02/18/optimizing-ci) blog post.

### Support for running tests (unit, integration, smoke) against browsers

In this milestone, we enabled all of our tests to run in browsers by leveraging the [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) library, which gives us increased coverage on browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. You can refer to our [VS Code Tests README](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/afcaaa613186832493bb1813dee048890a3c2a2f/test/README.md) for how to run these tests.

### Isolated Git extension tests

The entire Git extension test suite now runs as part of the integration test suite.
