# February 2020 (version 1.43)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.43 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/90371)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Untitled Editors

A new setting `workbench.editor.untitled.labelFormat` allows to control wether untitled editors should use the contents as title or not. Possible values are `content` or `name`. Configure `'workbench.editor.untitled.labelFormat': 'name'` to get the previous behaviour back where untitled editors would have a short title, such as `Untitled-1`.

When pasting contents into an untitled editor, we now automatically try to detect the language mode from the first line of the contents. For example, pasting XML now has a chance of setting the XML mode automatically upon paste if the first line contains the typical XML header `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`.

### Support for opening workpsaces via application links

For a while, VSCode supported to open files through protocol links (e.g. `vscode://file/<file-path>`). In this milestone we expanded the support to include opening folders or workspaces. The syntax is the same:

```
vscode://file/<path>
vscode-insiders://file/<path>
```

## Editor

### Definition Links in Peek

There is a new setting which changes how definition links work. By default, definition links open a separate editor but with `editor.definitionLinkOpensInPeek` you can make them always open in a peek editor.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.8.2

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Convert to template string refactoring

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Call hierarchy support for JavaScript and TypeScript

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Support for http(s) @link JSDoc inline tags

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Extension authoring

### CodeAction.disabled

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Custom Editor API

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Workspace Edit Metadata

We have finalized the `WorkspaceEditEntryMetadata` api. It allows to classify changes of a workspace edit, in particular if a change needs to be reviewed before being applied.

### CodeActionProviderMetadata.documentation

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Engineering

### "strict": true

### Support for running tests (unit, integration, smoke) against browsers

In this milestone we enabled all of our tests to run in browsers by leveraging the [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) library which gives us increased coverage on browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Safari. You can refer to our [README](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/afcaaa613186832493bb1813dee048890a3c2a2f/test/README.md) for how to run these tests.
