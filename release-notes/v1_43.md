# February 2020 (version 1.43)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.43 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/90371)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Progress notifications

Notifications that indicate a long running operation behave slightly differnt starting with this release:
* they do not provide a generic close button anymore because that gave the wrong impression about the operation getting canceled or not (you can still press the `Esc` key to hide them)
* they indicate the progress of their operation in the status bar whenever the notification is hidden while the operation is still ongoing

The latter helps to understand that an operation is continuing to run in the background (such as a long running save participant) after you have dismissed the notification.

### Untitled editors

A new setting `workbench.editor.untitled.labelFormat` lets you control whether untitled editors should use the file contents as the title or not. Possible values are `content` or `name`. Configure `'workbench.editor.untitled.labelFormat': 'name'` for the previous behavior, where untitled editors would have a short title, such as **Untitled-1**.

When pasting text into an untitled editor, VS Code now automatically tries to detect the language mode from the first line of text. For example, pasting XML will set the XML mode automatically upon paste if the first line contains the typical XML header `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`.

### Open workspaces via application links

VS Code supports opening files through protocol links (for example `vscode://file/<file-path>`). In this milestone, we've expanded support to include opening folders or workspaces.

The syntax is the same:

```bash
vscode://file/<path>
vscode-insiders://file/<path>
```

### Draggable sash corners

Did you know you could resize two orthogonal sashes simultaneously by grabbing and dragging the intersection between them? This already worked for editor sashes, and now it also works in the edges between editors and views:

### Welcome views

Welcome views are a new addition to the workbench which generalizes the capability of every view to create experiences for driving users to create content or configure VS Code, whenever there isn't any meaningful content to be displayed. Some views have already adopted this infrastructure, e.g. the File Explorer.

![Explorer Welcome view](images/1_43/explorer.png)

*Theme: [Github Sharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme)*

### Improved Source Control welcome view

Thanks to the new welcome view infrastructure, the Source Control view now provides a better experience out of the box for certain temporary situations, in which it would otherwise appear empty. It can guide users to open folders or clone repositories whenever no folder is open, for example; or it can also guide users to install git, whenever no installation is detected.

### Notarized macOS Builds

Visual Studio Code for macOS is finally notarized, so you should no longer see the following dialog:

![Notarization](images/1_43/notarization.jpg)

Read the [investigation issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74782) and [Apple's developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution) for more details.

## Editor

### Definition links in Peek

There is now more control over the behavior of the Go to Definition mouse gesture. By default, Go to Definition via mouse opens separate editor but with the new setting `editor.definitionLinkOpensInPeek`, they will open in a Peek view.

![Definition With Mouse in Peek](images/1_43/def_link_peek.gif)

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.8.2

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Convert to template string refactoring

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Call hierarchy support for JavaScript and TypeScript

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Support for http(s) @link JSDoc inline tags

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Debugging

### Rename "Debug" to "Run", changed icon
(emphasis on "Run"!)
TODO@isidorn

### Debug Console Grouping
We now support debug console grouping in VS Code. Debug extensions can let VS Code know when to group debug console output together under a common parent. For now the Mock Debug extension supports the console grouping debug protocol but soon other debug extensions will support it as well - most notably the JavaScript debugger.

![Debug Console grouping](images/1_43/debug-console.png)

### "debug.console.historySuggestions" setting
It is now possible to turn off debug console history suggestions via `debug.console.historySuggestions` which by default is true.

## Tasks

### Task quick pick updates

The task quick pick, shown when the **Run Task** command is executed, has been updated to show you which task providers are still running. If you don't need tasks from that provider, the "Stop Detecting" button will immediately show you the tasks that have been detected so far so you don't have to wait for any slow task providers.

### instanceLimit

The tasks `"runOptions"` now includes an `"instanceLimit"` which specifies the number of instances of a task that are permitted. The default `"instanceLimit"` is 1.

### promptString Password Input

The `"promptString"` `"input"` type can have `"password": true`, which will cause the quick input that shows to obscure the typed content like a password.

## Extension authoring

### Debugger Extension API

#### Contributable Debug View "Welcome" mode
TODO@isidorn

#### Debug Hover API
TODO@weinand

### CodeAction.disabled

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Custom Editor API

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Workspace Edit Metadata

We have finalized the `WorkspaceEditEntryMetadata` API. It allows extension authors to classify changes of a workspace edit, in particular if a change needs to be reviewed before being applied.

### CodeActionProviderMetadata.documentation

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Wecome View Content API

Certain views now support contributable welcome content from extensions. See the [original issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/89080) for more information. The views which have adopted this API are:

- `explorer`
- `scm`
- `debug`

As an example, here's a welcome view content contribution from the Git extension, on the `explorer` welcome view:

![Explorer Welcome view](images/1_43/explorer.png)

### Debug Adapter Protocol

#### Output Grouping
TODO@weinand

### OpenDialogOptions and SaveDialogOptions title

The `OpenDialogOptions` and `SaveDialogOptions` both have a proposed `title` property. Whether the `title` is shown is platform dependent, but if the platform does show the `title` it show shown above the save or open dialog. For example, the built-in command **Workspaces: Save Workspace As...** sets the title to "Save Workspace".

## Engineering

### "strict": true

### Support for running tests (unit, integration, smoke) against browsers

In this milestone, we enabled all of our tests to run in browsers by leveraging the [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) library which gives us increased coverage on browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. You can refer to our [VS Code Tests README](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/afcaaa613186832493bb1813dee048890a3c2a2f/test/README.md) for how to run these tests.

### Isolated Git extension tests

The entire Git extension test suite now runs as part of the integration test suite.
