# February 2020 (version 1.43)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.43 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/90371)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2020%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Progress notifications

Notifications that indicate a long running operation behave slightly differnt starting with this release:
* they do not provide a generic close button anymore because that gave the wrong impression about the operation getting canceled or not (you can still press the `Esc` key to hide them)
* they indicate the progress of their operation in the status bar whenever the notification is hidden while the operation is still ongoing

The latter helps to understand that an operation is continuing to run in the background (such as a long running save participant) after you have dismissed the notification.

![Progress Notification](images/1_43/progress-notification.gif)

### Untitled editors

A new setting `workbench.editor.untitled.labelFormat` lets you control whether untitled editors should use the file contents as the title or not. Possible values are `content` or `name`. Configure `'workbench.editor.untitled.labelFormat': 'name'` for the previous behavior, where untitled editors would have a short title, such as **Untitled-1**.

When pasting text into an untitled editor, VS Code now automatically tries to detect the language mode from the first line of text. For example, pasting XML will set the XML mode automatically upon paste if the first line contains the typical XML header `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`.

### Open workspaces via application links

VS Code supports opening files through protocol links (for example `vscode://file/<file-path>`). In this milestone, we've expanded support to include opening folders or workspaces.

The syntax is the same:

```bash
vscode://file/<path>
vscode-insiders://file/<path>
```

### Draggable sash corners

Did you know you could resize two orthogonal sashes simultaneously by grabbing and dragging the intersection between them? This already worked for editor sashes, and now it also works in the edges between editors and views:

*Theme: [Github Sharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme), Font: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)*

### Welcome views

Welcome views are a new addition to the workbench which generalizes the capability of every view to create experiences for driving users to create content or configure VS Code, whenever there isn't any meaningful content to be displayed. Some views have already adopted this infrastructure, e.g. the File Explorer.

![Explorer Welcome view](images/1_43/explorer.png)

*Theme: [Github Sharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme)*

### Improved Source Control welcome view

Thanks to the new welcome view infrastructure, the Source Control view now provides a better experience out of the box for certain temporary situations, in which it would otherwise appear empty. It can guide users to open folders or clone repositories whenever no folder is open, for example; or it can also guide users to install git, whenever no installation is detected.

![SCM Welcome view](images/1_43/scm.png)

*Theme: [Github Sharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme)*


### Notarized macOS Builds

Visual Studio Code for macOS is finally notarized, so you should no longer see the following dialog:

![Notarization](images/1_43/notarization.jpg)

Read the [investigation issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74782) and [Apple's developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution) for more details.

### Linux Accessibility

With the help of the commmunity we have focused on making VS Code accessible on Linux with Orca screen reader. Since Orca and Chromium are activly working on Screen Reader support there are a couple of things needed in order to have this fully working:
* Make sure to use latest Orca out of master. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/91063)
* Make sure to have `"editor.accessibilitySupport": "on"` in VS Code. You can do this using settings or `F1 > Show Accessibility Help` and press `Ctrl + E` to turn on accessiblitySupport

After that VS Code should work with Orca screen reader.

## Editor

### Definition links in Peek

There is now more control over the behavior of the Go to Definition mouse gesture. By default, Go to Definition via mouse opens separate editor but with the new setting `editor.definitionLinkOpensInPeek`, they will open in a Peek view.

![Definition With Mouse in Peek](images/1_43/def_link_peek.gif)


### Folding

There's a new setting that controls what happens when you click in the empty space behind a folded line (after the `...`):

`"editor.unfoldOnClickAfterEndOfLine": true`.

By default the setting is turned off.

## Languages

### TypeScript Semantic Highlighting

Semantic highlighting is now on per default for TypeScript and JavaScript. Semantic highlighting is provided by the TypeScript language server and goes on top of the syntax highlighting based on TextMate grammars. The default syntax (TextMate) highlighter classifies many tokens as `variables` and these are now resolved into namespaces, classes, parameters, and so on.

Semantic highlighting is controlled by the following setting:

```json
"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": true
```

### TypeScript 3.8.2

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Convert to template string refactoring

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Call hierarchy support for JavaScript and TypeScript

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Support for http(s) @link JSDoc inline tags

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## JSON

When associating file names to schemas you can now also use exlusion patterns. Exclusion patterns start with '!'. To match, at least one pattern needs to match and the last matching pattern must not an exclusion pattern.
```
	"json.schemas": [
		{
			"fileMatch": [
				"/receipts/*.json",
				"!/receipts/*.excluded.json"
			],
			"url": "./receipts.schema.json"
		}
	`]
```

There were multiple fixes for SCSS and LESS

## Debugging

### Rename "Run and Debug" to "Run"

We have renamed the "Run and Debug" view to just "Run". We wanted to simplify the name and to make it easier for new users to run their apps. Since debugging can be used to just run an app when no breakpoints are set or with `Run Without Debugging` action.
We have also renamed the main menu entry from "Debug" to "Run".
To align with the renames we have now also updated our activity bar icon. It is now a play button with a bug decoration to emphasize that the view can be used both for running and debugging.

![run](images/1_43/run.png)


### Debug Console Grouping
We now support debug console grouping in VS Code. Debug extensions can let VS Code know when to group debug console output together under a common parent. For now the Mock Debug extension supports the console grouping debug protocol but soon other debug extensions will support it as well - most notably the JavaScript debugger.

![Debug Console grouping](images/1_43/debug-console.png)

### "debug.console.historySuggestions" setting
It is now possible to turn off debug console history suggestions via `debug.console.historySuggestions` which by default is true.

## Integrated Terminal

### Unicode 11 support

The width of characters in the terminal now default to the unicode 11 widths. What this means to most people is that emojis will be correctly showing up as wide characters.

![Emoji are correctly wide chars](images/1_43/unicode11.png)

### Better alt+click to navigate prompt support

The terminal has a feature that lets you alt+click on a cell and the cursor will navigate to that cell. Historically when in a shell's prompt this only worked on a single line, even if it was wrapped. This has been improved to work on a full wrapped line.

![Alt click can move across wrapped lines](images/1_43/altclick.gif)

*Theme: [Sapphire](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire)*

Note that this may not work correctly on Windows yet but [recent changes to ConPTY](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/405) should improve this in the future.

## Tasks

### Task quick pick updates

The task quick pick, shown when the **Run Task** command is executed, has been updated to show you which task providers are still running. If you don't need tasks from that provider, the "Stop Detecting" button will immediately show you the tasks that have been detected so far so you don't have to wait for any slow task providers.

![Tasks Stop Detecting](images/1_43/tasks_stop_detecting.gif)
*Theme: [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme), Font: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)*

### instanceLimit

The tasks `"runOptions"` now includes an `"instanceLimit"` which specifies the number of instances of a task that are permitted. The default `"instanceLimit"` is 1.

### promptString Password Input

The `"promptString"` `"input"` type can have `"password": true`, which will cause the quick input that shows to obscure the typed content like a password.

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Settings Sync

We have been working since the last couple of months to allow synchronizing VS Code preferences across machines which is one of the most requested features from our users - [#2743](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/2743). In this milestone we are happy to anonuce that the preview of this feature will be available in our [insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) release. You can now have your preferences synchronized in all your VS Code set ups across machines. You can also bootstrap VS Code with your personal preferences on a fresh machine with minimal effort.

![Bootstrap VS Code using Settings Sync](images/1_43/settings-sync-import.gif)

**Supported Features**

- At present only Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, Extensions & Display Language are synchronized and going forward we are planning to add more. Please check our [Settings Sync Feature List](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asettings-sync+label%3Afeature-request).

- Machine settings (with `machine` or `machine-overridable` scopes) are not synchronized by default. You can also add or remove settings you want to this list from settings editor or using the setting `sync.ignoredSettings`.
![Ignored Settings](images/1_43/settings-sync-ignored-settings.png)
*Theme: GitHub Sharp*

- Keyboard Shortcuts are synchronized per platform by default. If your keyboard shortcuts are platform agnostic then, you can synchronize them across platforms by disabling the setting `sync.keybindingsPerPlatform`.

- All built-in and installed extensions are synchronized along with their global enablement state. You can skip synchronising an extension, from extensions view or using the setting `sync.ignoredExtensions`.
![Ignored Extensions](images/1_43/settings-sync-ignored-extensions.png)
*Theme: GitHub Sharp*

- Supports detecting conflicts in settings and keybindings while synchronizing. Conflicts are shown using the diff editor with incoming (remote) changes on the left side and local changes on the right side. You can resolve the conflicts by editing in the right side editor and merge the changes using the actions provided in the editor.
![Settings Sync Handling Conflicts](images/1_43/settings-sync-conflicts.gif)
*Themes: GitHub Sharp, GitHub Sharp Dark*

- At any moment you can turn off synchronization either on your current VS Code set up or on all your VS Code set ups. When choosing latter all your data will be removed from the cloud.
![Turn off Settings Sync](images/1_43/settings-sync-turnoff.gif)

**Notes**
- Settings Sync uses Microsoft account to store your VS Code preferences for synchronization and therefore you would need an account to use this.
- Please refer to [Settings Sync Documentation](https://aka.ms/vscode-settings-sync-help') for more information and help.

## Extension authoring

### Debugger Extension API

#### Contributable _Welcome View Content_ for Debug View

As specified in the **Welcome View Content API** section, the `debug` view is now open for _Welcome View Content_ contributions.
These can be used to guide beginning users to specific features that simplify running or debugging programs.

In order for the view to not become cluttered by too many _Welcome View Content_ contributions, we suggest that invidual contributions are only enabled for the language the user is really interested in. To facilitate this, we have introduced a new context key `debugStartLanguage` which is set to the last active editor language for which a debugger was used.

For example if your debugger targets Python you would contribute _Welcome View Content_ only if `debugStartLanguage == "python"`. In case your debugger targets multiple languages you can use the OR operator to combine multiple conditions.

#### New Debug Hover API

Today VS Code's debug hover uses a regular expression based heuristic to find an expression under the mouse that the VS Code debugger evaluates via a debugger and then shows the result in a hover. Since the regular expression is not configurable, not all languages are handled correctly (or they are not handled to the full extent possible). See [#84044](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/84044#issuecomment-576777272), [#89603](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/89603), or [#89332](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/89332) for typical problems.

In this milestone we've introduced new extension API to open up the behavior of the debug hover to language and/or debugger extensions.

An `EvaluatableExpressionProvider` can be registered for a language to provide an expression under the mouse that the VS Code debugger will evaluate against an active debug session.

Here is a very simple example from [Mock debug]() that shows a (naive) implementation based on `getWordRangeAtPosition` API:

```ts
vscode.languages.registerEvaluatableExpressionProvider('markdown', {
  provideEvaluatableExpression(document: vscode.TextDocument, position: vscode.Position):
                              vscode.ProviderResult<vscode.EvaluatableExpression> {
    const wordRange = document.getWordRangeAtPosition(position);
    if (wordRange) {
      return new vscode.EvaluatableExpression(wordRange);
    }
    return undefined; // nothing evaluatable found under mouse
  }
});
```

#### VS Code Debug no longer escaping whitespace

The VS Code debugger UI no longer escapes or quotes any whitespace received from a debug extension or debug adapter. For example all strings received in DAP Variables or as DAP Output events are shown in the UI as they are without modification.

This means that it is now up to the debug extension or debug adapter to decide if whitespace needs to be escaped before sending the data to VS Code. More details can be found in [#73845](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/73845).

### CodeAction.disabled

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Terminal.exitStatus

Extensions can now determine whether terminals have exited and if they did, which exit code was used (if any).

```ts
window.onDidCloseTerminal(t => {
  if (t.exitStatus && t.exitStatus.code) {
  	vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Exit code: ${t.exitStatus.code}`);
  }
});
```

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Custom Editor API

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Workspace Edit Metadata

We have finalized the `WorkspaceEditEntryMetadata` API. It allows extension authors to classify changes of a workspace edit, in particular if a change needs to be reviewed before being applied.

### CodeActionProviderMetadata.documentation

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Wecome View Content API

Certain views now support contributable welcome content from extensions. See the [original issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/89080) for more information. The views which have adopted this API are:

- `explorer`
- `scm`
- `debug`

As an example, here's a welcome view content contribution from the Git extension, on the `explorer` welcome view:

![Explorer Welcome view](images/1_43/explorer.png)

*Theme: [Github Sharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme)*

### Debug Adapter Protocol

#### Output Grouping
TODO@weinand

### OpenDialogOptions and SaveDialogOptions title

The `OpenDialogOptions` and `SaveDialogOptions` both have a proposed `title` property. Whether the `title` is shown is platform dependent, but if the platform does show the `title` it show shown above the save or open dialog. For example, the built-in command **Workspaces: Save Workspace As...** sets the title to "Save Workspace".

## Engineering

### "strict": true

### Improved build performance

We have recently improved the VS Code build performance considerably. Read more in the [Improving CI Build Times
](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2020/02/18/optimizing-ci) blog post.

### Support for running tests (unit, integration, smoke) against browsers

In this milestone, we enabled all of our tests to run in browsers by leveraging the [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) library which gives us increased coverage on browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. You can refer to our [VS Code Tests README](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/afcaaa613186832493bb1813dee048890a3c2a2f/test/README.md) for how to run these tests.

### Isolated Git extension tests

The entire Git extension test suite now runs as part of the integration test suite.
