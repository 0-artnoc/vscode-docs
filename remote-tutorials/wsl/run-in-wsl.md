# Run in Windows Subsystem for Linux

Once installed, head back over the WSL terminal, make sure you are in the helloWorld folder, and type in "code ." to launch VS Code (the "." tells VS Code to open the current folder).

The first thing you'll see is a message about "Installing VS Code Server" (the c7d83e57â€¦ number is the version of the VS Code Server that matches the client-side tools you just installed). VS Code is installing a small server on the Linux side that the desktop VS Code will then talk to.

That server will then install and host extensions in WSL, so that they run in the context of the tools and frameworks installed in WSL. In other words, your Python extension will run against the Python installed in WSL, not against what is installed on the Windows side, as it should for the proper development experience.

The next thing that happens is VS Code will start and open the helloWorld folder. You may see a quick notification telling you that VS Code is connecting to WSL, and you may be prompted to allow access to the Node.js-based server.

Now, when we hover over hello.py, we get the proper Linux path.

## Integrated Terminal

If that doesn't convince you we're connected to the Linux subsystem, run **Terminal** > **New Terminal** (Ctrl+`) to open a new terminal instance.

You'll start a new instance of the bash shell in WSL, again from VS Code running on Windows.

**Tip**: In the lower left corner of the Status Bar, you can see that we're connected to our **WSL: Ubuntu** instance.
