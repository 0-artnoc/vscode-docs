## Add SSH keys to your VM

In the previous step, we generated an SSH key pair. We'll take the public key and paste it into our VM setup, by copying the contents of the `id_rsa.pub`. You also want to allow your VM to accept inbound SSH traffic.

A cool feature of using Azure VMs is the ability to enable auto-shutdown (because let's face it, we all forget to turn off our VMsâ€¦). If you go to the **Management** tab, you can set the time you want to shut down the VM daily.

Select **Review and Create** and Azure will deploy your VM for you!

Next, connect to your virtual machine through SSH.
