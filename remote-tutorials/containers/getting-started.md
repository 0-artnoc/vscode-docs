# Remote development in Containers

This tutorial walks you through running Visual Studio Code in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container using the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.

## Prerequisites

You need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.
