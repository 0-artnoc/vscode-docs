### Checkout a Pull Request or Branch in an isolated container

[Repository Containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/master/docs/remote/containers.md#quick-start-open-a-git-repository-in-an-isolated-container-volume) have been supported since several releases.
These containers use isolated, local [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) instead binding to the local filesystem. In addition to not polluting your file tree, local volumes have the added benefit of improved performance on Windows and macOS. In this release we have added support to checkout a Pull Request directly into a repository container. You can checkout a Pull Request into a container using:

- the **Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container** command and entering the corresponding Pull Request, e.g. `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-npm-scripts/pull/111`
- in the [GitHub Pull Request Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) you can select the PR and use the command **Checkout Pull Request in Dev Container**.

When opening a Pull Request into a dev container then the GitHub Pull Request extension is automatically installed into the container and the Pull Request is checked out, ready for you to review. You can switch to the PR description from the status line:

When the repository does not yet contain a dev container configuration you will be prompted to select one and it will be added.

There is support to quickly create a unique volume for a PR review. You will be prompted to remove the unique volume when removing the container from the Remote Explorer.

In addition to entering the GitHub URLs for Pull Requests you can also enter the URLs for branches and commits. In this case the corresponding branch or commit will be checked out when creating the container.

>Note: Opening a PR from a private repository is currently only supported when using the VS Code Insiders version.
