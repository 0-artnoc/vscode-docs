# February 2018 (version 1.32)

## VS Code Remote Core

### Support for remote (multi root) workspaces

Since this release it's also possible to open a workspace (`.code-workspace`) from a remote file system.
As usual, such a workspace refers to multiple root folders, typically relative to the workspace file location.

When in a remote window you start a new workspace with `Add Folder to Workspace...`. From an remote terminal you can use `code-wsl folder1 folder2`. Save it with `Save Workspace As`.

Open a workspace with `Open Workspace` or from the recent menu.

Important: It is the location of the workspace file that signals wheter we need to start a remote window or not, so the workspace file should always be where the root folders are.

Mixing local with remote folders is not recommended as will lead to strange user experiences such rich language support for one folder but not the other one.

### Initial support for localizations in remote extension host

Support has been added to run the remote extension host in a localized setup. This works for SSH and WSL mode, but still has issue in a Docker container setup.

### Improved remote file picker

The file picker for remote files has been updated to be more user and keyboard friendly. The Save As picker is now only one step and both Save As and Open use a modified quick pick to better emulate how the System file picker works. There are still features missing from the file picker, such as an input validation message.

## SSH

### Show SSH Remote Name

When connected to an SSH remote, we now show the name of the remote in the window titlebar and statusbar. This makes it much easier to keep track of which machine a window is connected to.

For example, this window is connected to an SSH remote named `remote-box1`.

### Support for Specifying User ID

We now allow users to specify their user ID when connecting to a SSH box:

### Built-in Editing Support for SSH Config Files

Based on a generous contribution of the author of the SSH Tools extension we now have syntax highlighting and basic Intellisense for SSH config files out-of-the-box.

### SSH Explorer

To lay the foundation for an improved Getting Started experience we continued to improve the SSH Explorer. The explorer can be enabled with
```json
"remote.SSH.enableHostsExplorer": true
```

![ssh-explorer](images/1_32/ssh-explorer.png)

*SSH CONNECTIONS* lists all configured hosts and shows you the recently opend folders per host. It also indicates the active host or folder. There are inline actions to open a new empty window on a host, open a recently open folder, or remove a folder from the list.

*FORWARDED PORTS* shows the list of established SSH tunnels and allos users to manange tunnels.

*HELP AND FEEDBACK* currently links to our private documentation and GH issues and will be replaced with twitter feedback, and our public doc and issue repository.

### Support Windows SSH Agent

When connecting to an SSH remote, VS Code can find SSH keys that have been stored in the SSH agent, and can add a new SSH key to the agent. This worked previously on Mac/Linux and now works on Windows too.

### Improved connection flow

We made many improvements to the SSH connection flow to reduce failures and improve error messages.

### Extension Debugging

It is now possible to debug extensions on the same SSH host where the extension project is located without further configuration. Just press F5 in a remote SSH project to run the extension in the VS Code debugger on the same SSH host.

## Dev Containers

### Git Credential Forwarding

To avoid having to enter Git credentials over and over again, a Dev Container image can register the `code-wsl` CLI as a credential helper for Git. All requests for credentials are forwarded by the CLI to the host machine's credential helper (which might store them in your key chain, depending on which helper you have installed).

### Development image for Node

We provide a Docker image for Node development with nvm, Yarn, ESLint, and Git credential forwarding preinstalled. It is offered as one of the base images when running the `Create Container Configuration File...` command. It is published (under a personal account for now) on Docker Hub as `chrmarti/node`.

### Name for a Dev Container

The `devContainer.json` takes an optional `"name"` property that will be used when referring to that container in the Recent Folders list and the remote statusbar item.

### Improved Error Handling

Additional checks and improved handling of errors helps guide the user towards getting a Dev Container up and running. The error dialog when setting up the container failed offers `Reopen Window`, `Rebuild Container` and `Open Folder Locally` actions to make it easy to iterate on a configuration.

### Extension Debugging

It is now possible to debug a locally stored extension inside a container.

Since this is an optionally feature it requires to add a new boolean property `devContainer` to the extension's launch config like this:
```json
      {
         "name": "Run Extension",
         "type": "extensionHost",
         "request": "launch",
         "args": [
            "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}",
         ],
         "outFiles": [
            "${workspaceFolder}/out/**/*.js"
         ],
         "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch",
         "devContainer": true
      },
```
In addition a `devContainer.json` file with this contents must be created in the `.vscode` directory:
```json
{
      "image": "ubuntu:latest"
}
```
If you now press F5 a new dev container with remote VS Code and the mounted extension project folder is created and then a new VS Code instance is launched. Then the VS Code debugger attaches to the remote extension host and all remote files are mapped to the local extension folder.

Please note: currently the remote VS Code needs to open the extension folder as its workspace folder because mounting inside the dev container is tied to the workspace and not (yet) to the "extensionDevelopmentPath". To lift this limitation is covered by https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote/issues/518.

## WSL

### Improved Error Handling

Additional checks have been added to improve the user experience when trying to open a WSL windows in a OS that has no WSL installed.

### Extension Debugging

It is now possible to debug extensions on the same WSL where the extension project is located without further configuration. Just press F5 in a WSL project to run the extension in the VS Code debugger in WSL.

## Web Companion

### Initial support to open a simple workbench in the browser

A new branch `web-hackathon` (on https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote) was pushed to run a minimal workbench in a browser. Simply checkout that branch and run `yarn web` from the command line and it will open a browser on localhost with the workbench opening.

**Note:** the file system is not implemented for real yet and most services are simply implemented as a mock until they are converted to run in a browser environment.

## Engineering

### Connection

VS Code now uses web sockets to communicate with the remote extenion host agent. The remote extension host agent is now also an HTTP server.

### Self hosting

#### SSH

We are self-hosting on Azure VMs using VNC to connect to the UI and on VMs running on the local box. If you want to join in you can start with reading [our documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs-pr/blob/master/docs/headless/headless-ssh-selfhosting.md).

#### Dev Containers

We are self-hosting [vscode-remote](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote) using a Docker image starting a VNC server. We develop with VS Code connected to the Dev Container and in that container we launch VS Code out-of-source. The `devContainer.json` is checked in to the repository and there is [documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs-pr/blob/master/docs/headless/headless-containers-selfhosting.md) for you to give this setup a try.

### Running Integration Tests

#### SSH
The script `./scripts/test-ssh-integration.sh|bat` has been added which runs the integration tests in an SSH host-connected window.

```
./scripts/test-ssh-integration.bat my_ssh_host
```

#### WSL
To test the WSL integration, you either run `./scripts/test-wsl-integration.bat` on the Windows side, or open a WSL shell and invoke `scripts/test-wsl-integration.sh`. For this to work, you need a WSL selfhost setup, as described here: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote/wiki/VSCode-WSL-setup#development-setup

#### Dev Containers
There was also an exploration into setting up and running the tests in a local docker container that exposes an SSH service. This only works on Windows currently and may be removed in the future depending on how useful we find it.

```
./test/remote/test_docker_ssh.bat
```
