# June 2019 (version 1.35)

## Remote in VS Code Stable

Until now, the remote extensions have now only been available in the Insiders build of VS Code, but now, the SSH, WSL, and Containers remote extensions can all be used in the stable 1.35 build of VS Code as well.

## VS Code Remote Core

### In a remote window, "machine"-scoped settings in User Settings are ignored

Settings that relate to paths on a particular machine are given the "machine" setting scope. One example is `git.path`. In a remote window, these settings can no longer be set in User Settings. They should be set in Remote Settings (or Workspace/Folder Settings) instead.

## SSH

### Notable Fixes

- [17](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/17): SSH can't connect to a machine with `/tmp` mounted with `noexec`
- [19](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/19), [33](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/33): SSH can't connect when some non-Bash shells are set as the default
- [437](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/437): Remote server should discover the user's environment using their configured shell
