# June 2019 (version 1.35)

## Remote in VS Code Stable

Until now, the remote extensions have now only been available in the Insiders build of VS Code, but now, the SSH, WSL, and Containers remote extensions can all be used in the stable 1.35 build of VS Code as well.

## VS Code Remote Core

### Machine Scoped Settings

In a remote window, machine scoped settings are no longer can be set in User Settings and they can be set only in Remote/Workspace/Folder Settings instead.

### Extension Packs

Installing an extension pack, which is not tagged as an UI extension, in a remote window will now install any packed UI extensions in local machine also.
