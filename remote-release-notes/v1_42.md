# January 2020 (version 1.42)

## VS Code Remote Core

### Piping to VS Code

Piping content to the `code` launch command now also works in the Integrated Terminal of remote windows:

```bash
    `ps aux | code -`
```

### Unified port forwarding experience

The Remote Explorer has a single port forwarding view that the SSH and Containers extension have adopted. From the Port Forwarding view you can see the ports you have currently forwarded through VS Code, forward additional ports, label forwarded ports, and copy the local address. You can also see suggested ports to forward based on what processes are currently running. If you want to have your forwarded ports restored when you open the same folder or workspace again, set the `remote.restoreForwardedPorts` setting to `true`. 

## SSH

### Auto-detect remote OS

In improving our support for Windows remotes, the Remote-SSH extension is now capable of detecting the OS of the remote as it connects to it. Previously, it was required to use the `remote.SSH.windowsRemotes` setting to declare a particular remote as Windows. Now, this is not needed, as long as you have set `remote.SSH.useLocalServer` to opt-in to the new "connection sharing mode" (see [the v1.39 release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/master/remote-release-notes/v1_39.md#ssh-connection-sharing) for more details).

The remote must be Windows 10, running an OpenSSH server, and you must use VS Code [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).

## WSL

### Reveal in Explorer

The **Reveal in Explorer** command is now available in a Remote - WSL window. It will open the Windows Explorer on the WSL resource. For files not located in `/mnt/c/..`, this will use the `wsl$` network share:

## Containers

### Pre-built container images

You can now take advantage of an initial set of pre-built development container images that include common dependencies, such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), and [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/). Their sources are available in the [vscode-dev-containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers) repository and we will be adding more as time goes on.

These same images are also used when you select the related language / platform by using **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files** or the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container** / **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** commands from the Command Pallette (`kbstyle(F1)`) on an empty folder.

Check out our [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-vscode-devcontainers) for a list of available images.
