# January 2020 (version 1.42)

## VS Code Remote Core

### Piping to VS Code

Piping content to the code command now also works in the integrated terminal of remote windows:

    `ps aux | code-insiders -`

## SSH

### Auto-detect remote OS

In improving our support for Windows remotes, the Remote-SSH extension is now capable of detecting the OS of the remote as it connects to it. Previously, it was required to use the `remote.SSH.windowsRemotes` setting to declare a particular remote as Windows. Now, this is not needed, as long as you have set `remote.SSH.useLocalServer` to opt-in to the new "connection sharing mode" (see [the v1.39 release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/master/remote-release-notes/v1_39.md#ssh-connection-sharing) for more details).

The remote must be Windows 10, running an OpenSSH server, and you must use [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).

## WSL

### Reveal in Explorer

`Reveal in Explorer` is now also possible in a Remote - WSL window. It will open the Windows Explorer on the WSL resource. For files not located in `/mnt/c/..` this will use the `wsl$` network share:
