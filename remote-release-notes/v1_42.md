# January 2020 (version 1.42)

## VS Code Remote Core

### Piping to VS Code

Piping content to the `code` launch command now also works in the Integrated Terminal of remote windows:

```bash
    `ps aux | code -`
```

## SSH

### Auto-detect remote OS

In improving our support for Windows remotes, the Remote-SSH extension is now capable of detecting the OS of the remote as it connects to it. Previously, it was required to use the `remote.SSH.windowsRemotes` setting to declare a particular remote as Windows. Now, this is not needed, as long as you have set `remote.SSH.useLocalServer` to opt-in to the new "connection sharing mode" (see [the v1.39 release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/master/remote-release-notes/v1_39.md#ssh-connection-sharing) for more details).

The remote must be Windows 10, running an OpenSSH server, and you must use VS Code [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).

## WSL

### Reveal in Explorer

The **Reveal in Explorer** command is now available in a Remote - WSL window. It will open the Windows Explorer on the WSL resource. For files not located in `/mnt/c/..`, this will use the `wsl$` network share:

## Containers

### Pre-built container images

You can now take advantage of an inital set of pre-built development container images that include common dependencies, [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) and [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/) Their sources are available in the [vscode-dev-containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers) repository and we will be adding more as time goes on.

These same images are also used when you select the related language / platform by using **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files** or the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container** / **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** commands from the Command Pallette (`kbstyle(F1)`) on an empty folder.

Check out our **[Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-vscode-devcontainers)** for a list of available images.
