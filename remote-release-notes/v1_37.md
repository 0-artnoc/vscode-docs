# July 2019 (version 1.37)

## VS Code Remote Core

### Empty remote window presentation

When an empty remote window is opened (no folder, no workspace file) and the startup editor is not the Welcome page, we now show the projects view and the terminal. Use the **Open** button from the explorer to select a remote folder, or use the terminal to open files and folders.

### Remote settings

The Remote settings file now supports edit actions.

### Install Local Extensions in Remote Server

There is a new command **Remote: Install Local Extensions in** when running remotely to select and install local extensions in the remote server.

## WSL

### Experimental Alpine Linux support

The Remote - WSL extension now supports the Alpine WSL distribution on VS Code Insiders.

To use an Alpine distro:

- You need to be on Windows 10, May 2019 Update (1903).
- Install **Alpine WSL** from the Microsoft Store.
- Install the latest Remote - WSL extension in a [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) build.
- The Remote - WSL extension will prompt you to install `libstdc++` inside Alpine. To do that, open an Alpine WSL shell and run `su -c 'apk update && apk add libstdc++'`.

To bring up the Remote - WSL window (instance) either:

- Run `code-insiders .` from the WSL shell.
- Invoke the **Remote-WSL: New Window using Distro** command and pick **Alpine**.

**Note**: We are holding this back from the Stable release to allow extension authors to catch up with the additional platform. See [Supporting Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions) for details.
