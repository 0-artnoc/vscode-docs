# July 2019 (version 1.37)

## VS Code Remote Core

### Empty remote window presentation

When an empty remote window is opened (no folder, no workspace file) and the startup editor is not the welcome page,  we now show the projects view and the terminal.
Use the `Open` button from the explorer to select a remote folder, or use the terminal to open files and folders.

### Install Local Extensions in Remote Server

A new action is introduced to remote window that will allow you to select and install local extensions in remote server.

## Containers


## WSL

### Experimental Alpine Linux support

The Remote WSL extension now also support the Alpine WSL distro.
- you need to be on Windows 10, May 2019 Update (1903)
- install `Alpine WSL` from the Microsoft Store
- install the latest Remote WSL extension in an [VSCode Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) build.
(We are holding this back from the Stable release to allow for extension authors to catch up with the additional platform. See [Supporting Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions) for details)

- The Remote WSL etension will ask you to install `libstdc++` inside Alpine. To do that, open a Alpine WSL shell and run `su -c 'apk update && apk add libstdc++'`.
- To bring up the WSL Remote Window:
   - run `code-insiders .` from the WSL shell
   or
   - invoke the `Remote-WSL: New Window using Distro` command and pick `Alpine`
