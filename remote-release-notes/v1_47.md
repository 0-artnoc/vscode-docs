## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

## SSH

## Remote server can listen on socket instead of port

If you are connecting to a multi-user remote, you may not want the VS Code Remote Server to open a port that's accessible to any user on the machine. We've added the setting `remote.SSH.remoteServerListenOnSocket` which tells the server on a Linux or macOS host to switch to using Unix sockets that are locked down to a particular user instead. This socket is then forwarded over SSH instead of the port.
