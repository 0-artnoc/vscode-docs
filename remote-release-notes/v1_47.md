## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

## SSH

## Remote server can listen on socket instead of port

If you are connecting to a multi-user remote, you may not want the VS Code Remote Server to open a port that's accessible to any user on the machine. We've added the setting `remote.SSH.remoteServerListenOnSocket` which tells the server on a Linux or macOS host to switch to using Unix sockets that are locked down to a particular user instead. This socket is then forwarded over SSH instead of the port.

## Containers (version 0.126.0)

### Guidance to open a repository in a volume

When opening a Git repository folder the "Reopen in Container" notification now offers to clone and reopen the repository in a Docker volume. Using a Docker volume has better disk performance because it uses a Linux filesystem without any extra layer between the Linux Kernel and the filesystem. (We do not show this guideance on Linux, but the feature is still available under `F1` > `Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container`.)

If you choose `Don't Show Again` you are now asked if you want to not see this notification only for the current folder or for any folder. If you later want to see it again you can now reset it for all folders with `F1` > `Remote-Containers: Reset Don't Show Reopen Notification`.

### Attach configuration by container name

In addition to having configuration files per Docker image, we now also support configuration files per container name. To create one first attach VS Code to a running container and then create a configuration for its name with `F1` > `Remote-Containers: Open Named Container Configuration File`.

From that on the existing `F1` > `Remote-Containers: Open Container Configuration File` will open the name configuration and `F1` > `Open Attached Container Configuration File...` shows both image and name configurations.
