# January 2018 (version 1.31)

## SSH

### Support for Windows clients

It is now possible use your Windows machine to work against a remote SSH box.

### Use the library implementation

The original implementation of SSH uses your local SSH installation. We now support a setting that enables an alternative library-based implementation. The advantage is that we can use a single code path on all client-platforms.

```json
"remote.SSH.useLib": true
```

### Open configuration from within commands

In order to make it easier to configure an SSH host, we know always show the `Configure SSH Hosts...` action at the bottom of all relevant SSH remote commands.

### Improved port-forwarding

We show all already forwarded ports when you choose `Remote: Forwards Ports from Active SSH host...`. When you select on of those we copy the address directly to the clipboard.

### Oh No! There is an SSH Explorer

To experiment with how to improve discoverability and getting-started we implemented a first cut of an SSH Hosts explorer. It's hidden behind a setting:

```json
"remote.SSH.enableHostsExplorer": true
```

It lists all configured hosts, shows you on which one you are currently working, and allows you to open folders, new windows, and terminals.

We plan to continue this exploration in March.

## Code command in terminal

You can now use the code command (`code-wsl`) in the integrated terminal to open files and folders.

Note that for SSH and for Dev containers the command is only available in the integrated terminal and offers a limited set of options.

For WSL, the command is also available in shells ouside of VSCode and supports almost all the standard VSCode options. The reason is from WSL shells we can reach out in the local Windows installation and can actually call the command there.

## Dev Containers

### Expose multiple app ports

The `devContainer.json`'s `"appPort"` now can take an array of ports. If the port is specified as a number, that port will be forwarded to `localhost:<port>`. If the port is a string, it will be passed verbatim to `docker run` when starting the container.

### Rebuild current container

The command `Remote: Rebuild Container` rebuilds the currently running container. Great when working on the `devContainer.json` or `Dockerfile`.

### Use injection of VS Code Server

DevContainers now "inject" (using `docker exec`) VS Code Server and set up port forwarding (also using `docker exec`) to connect to remote server. This has the advantage of not requiring the container to expose a port for VS Code and consolidates some of our code paths.

Port forwarding can be disabled by specifying a `"devPort"` in the `devContainer.json`.

### Attach VS Code to a running container

You can `Attach Visual Studio Code` to an existing container from the Docker extension's viewlet. Open the context menu on a running container and run `Attach Visual Studio Code` from there.

## Extension dependency across machine boundary

We have added support for a workspace extension to have an extension dependency to a UI extension. This only works if the UI extension is marked with `"api": "none"` in its `package.json`. The `commands` namespace can be used to communicate between the two extensions e.g.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>UI Extension</th>
    <th>Workspace Extension</th>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>

```js
{
    "publisher": "pub",
    "name": "front",
    "api": "none",
    "extensionKind": "ui"
    // ...
}
```
</td>
<td>

```js
{
    "publisher": "pub",
    "name": "back",
    "extensionDependencies": [
        "pub.front"
    ]
    // ...
}
```
</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

```js
const {commands} = require('vscode');

exports.activate = function() {
    commands.registerCommand(
        'frontend',
        (arg) => {
            return 5 + arg
        }
    );
};
```
</td>
<td>

```js
const {commands} = require('vscode');

exports.activate = function() {
    commands.executeCommand('frontend', 4).then((r) => {
        console.log(`result ==> `, r);
    });
}
```
</td>

</tr>
