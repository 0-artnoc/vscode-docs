## Containers

### Save configuration for images

When attaching to a container we now save the last workspace folder, the installed extensions and the dynamically forwarded ports. Next time you attach to the same container or a container of the same image (and tag) this configuration will be reapplied.

The `Remote-Containers: Open Container Configuration File` command will open the current configuration while being attached to a container and the `Remote-Containers: Open Attached Container Configuration File...` command will show a list of all configurations.

```json
{
	"workspaceFolder": "/scripts",
	"extensions": [
		"ms-vscode.azurecli"
	],
	"forwardPorts": [
		3000
	]
}
```

### Prompt to rebuild container

You now get asked if you want to rebuild the container when the `devcontainer.json`, `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` files have changed.

### Additional Docker extension settings

The [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) comes with 3 settings for configuring the connection to a remote Docker daemon and all 3 are supported now by Remote-Containers:

- Docker hostname (same as DOCKER_HOST environment variable).
- Docker certificate path (same as DOCKER_CERT_PATH environment variable).
- Docker TLS verification (same as DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY environment variable).
