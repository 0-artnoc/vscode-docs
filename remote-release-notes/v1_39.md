# September 2019 (version 1.39)

## VS Code Remote Core

### Opening a local file

The default behavior when opening a local file while in a remote window is now to open that file in the same window. To return to the previous behavior where opening a local file would open a new window you can set `"window.openFilesInNewWindow": "on"`.

### Auto expand/collapse remote explorer sections

If you have all of the VS Code Remote extensions installed, there can be a lot of noise in the Remote Explorer. Now when you open the Remote Explorer in a remote window, only the sections that are related to the current remote type will be expanded, and other sections will be collapsed by default.

## WSL

### Remote Explorer

WSL has joined Containers and SSH in the Remote Explorer. You can see your installed distros, connect to a distro, set your default distro, and see the folders you've opened on a distro in the Remote Explorer.

### Environment Setup Script

You can now make changes to the environment in which the VS Code Remote is started and run additional services. To do so, create a script `~/.vscode-server/server-env-setup` (Insiders: `~/.vscode-server-insiders/server-env-setup`). If present, the script is sourced on before the server is started.

The script needs to be a valid Bourne shell script. Be aware that an invalid script will prevent the server from starting up.

Check the WSL Log (Remote WSL: Open WSL Log) for output and errors.

## Containers

### Save configuration for images when attaching to a container

When attaching to a container we now save the last workspace folder, the installed extensions and the dynamically forwarded ports. Next time you attach to the same container or a container of the same image (and tag) this configuration will be reapplied.

The `Remote-Containers: Open Container Configuration File` command will open the current configuration while being attached to a container and the `Remote-Containers: Open Attached Container Configuration File...` command will show a list of all configurations.

```json
{
	"workspaceFolder": "/scripts",
	"extensions": [
		"ms-vscode.azurecli"
	],
	"forwardPorts": [
		3000
	]
}
```

### Open Repository in a container

There is a new command `Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...`. This command allows you to work on a repository in a container without locally cloning it first. It allows you to work with an isolated copy of a repository for a PR review or to investigate another branch without impacting what you have currently checked out. This command requires that the repository has a `devcontainer.json` file. In the current version the repository has to be public.

Repository Containers use isolated, local Docker volumes instead binding to the local filesystem. In addition to not polluting your file tree, local volumes have the added benefit of improved performance on Windows and macOS.

To try it out run `Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...` and enter `microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node`, for example.

The `Container` section of the `Remote Explorer` shows the details of Repository Container, like the source repository and the local docker volume. Removing a Repository Container from the explorer will prompt you whether you want to delete the volume.


### Prompt to rebuild container

You now get asked if you want to rebuild the container when the `devcontainer.json`, `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` files have changed.

### Additional Docker extension settings

The [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) comes with 3 settings for configuring the connection to a remote Docker daemon and all 3 are supported now by Remote-Containers:

- Docker hostname (same as DOCKER_HOST environment variable).
- Docker certificate path (same as DOCKER_CERT_PATH environment variable).
- Docker TLS verification (same as DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY environment variable).

## SSH

### SSH connection sharing

Currently, every window attached to a remote via SSH uses its own SSH connection. This adds a little extra time to load the window, and if you are using password auth, you will have to enter your password again every time you open a folder or reload the window. We are developing a new mode that creates one SSH connection per connected remote, managed by a local server, and lets multiple windows share that connection. This makes opening windows faster and reduces the number of times that you will have to type your password. If you want to try this experimental mode, just set `"remote.SSH.useLocalServer": true`.


### Remote - SSH for Windows remotes

We now have experimental support for connecting to Windows remotes. The remote must be Windows 10, running an OpenSSH server, and you must use [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/). You can try it out by setting `"remote.SSH.remoteIsWindows": true`.


### Friendlier error message for remotes that don't meet Linux prerequisites

If you connect to a remote that doesn't have the minimum required versions of glibc or libstdc++, currently VS Code will fail to connect with one of a few confusing error messages. We have added a new warning popup that will make the problem more clear.


### Eliminating the "Remote - SSH: Explorer" extension

There have been three "Remote - SSH" extensions. One giving language support for SSH configuration files, one powering the SSH explorer, and one for actually connecting to SSH remotes. Now that the Remote Explorer is built into VS Code, we have merged the second two extensions. You will get a prompt to uninstall the Explorer extension.
