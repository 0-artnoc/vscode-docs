# November 2019 (version 1.41)

## VS Code Remote Core

### Remote Explorer make-over

The Remote Explorer has been given a new look to optimize it for how it's used and to make it less busy.

### Download extensions locally

You can now configure VS Code to download extensions always locally while installing extensions in a remote window. To enable this, use setting `remote.downloadExtensionsLocally`.

## WSL

### Support for ARM

The VS Code Remote Server now also runs on Windows 10 ARM-based PCs such as the Surface Pro X.

### Server download and install improvements

Downloading the server behind proxies had been improved. Downloads and the unpacked bits are now verified to avoid corrupted installs.

### Multi distro support for WSL on Windows 10 builds 1803 and 1809

Users on Windows 10 1803 and 1809 now can open any Linux distribution. If the distro is not the default, the Remote WSL extension will ask if it's ok the change the default distro.

### Open folder and reload performance

Changing the input of a Remote WSL Window is now much faster.

## Containers

### Trying out the Container Samples has become much simpler

You can now try a remote sample in a single step. Just run `Remote Containers: Try a Sample...` and select the repository you want to try.

This command clones the selected sample repository into a docker volume and opens it inside a container.

### Improved provisioning and startup performance

Performance is improved for several scenarios: Creating new containers, reusing existing ones and when the VS Code window is reloaded. (See [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/1823#issuecomment-557157018) for sample measurements.)

### More flexible opening of a repository into a Container

The command [Remote Containers: Open Repository in Container...](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-a-public-git-repository-in-an-isolated-container-volume) is now more flexible and supports to pick the docker volume the repository should be cloned into. This enables that you can open the same repository into different volumes to investigate different branches of the repository.

You can now also clone multiple repositories into the same volume so that you do not have to manage multiple volumes.

### New configuration options for the VS Code Server

The `devcontainer.json` and the configuration files for attaching to containers have new options for the VS Code Server:

Property | Description
-|-
`"remoteUser"` | The user the VS Code Server will be started with.
`"remoteEnv"` | A map of environment variables and values the VS Code Server will be started with.

### New configuration options for single containers

The `devcontainer.json` for containers based on a Dockerfile or a Docker image has new options for the container:

Property | Description
-|-
`"containerUser"` | The user the container will be started with.
`"containerEnv"` | A map of environment variables and values the container will be started with.
`"mounts"` | Additional mount points for the container.

### Settings when attaching to containers

Configuration files for attaching to containers can now also have a `"settings"` property for machine settings. These are copied to the container when connecting to it for the first time. Changes to the machine settings of a container are then recorded in the configuration file.

### Forwarding SSH agent

The local SSH agent is now forwarded into the container. E.g., if you are using SSH to checkout your repository, Git support seamlessly works when opening the folder in a container and the key is registered with the local SSH agent.

### Support for `ssh://` as Docker host

The `"docker.host"` setting (or `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable) can now be set to a `ssh://user@host` URI to connect to a Docker host using SSH. Currently a private key needs to be registered with the local SSH agent for authentication to succeed.

### ARM support in preview

Support for ARMv7 32-bit and ARMv8 64-bit is available as a preview feature.

### Updated UID/GID on Linux

On Linux when using a single container based on a Dockerfile or a Docker image the user the VS Code Server will be run with is updated to use the same UID and GID as the local user VS Code runs with. This ensures the files created with VS Code in the container are also owned by the local user.

This only works when the container's user is not root and the target UID and GID are not already used by an existing user and group.

There is a new property `"updateRemoteUserUID"` in the `devcontainer.json ` which can be set to false to disable this feature.


## Remote Extension authoring

### Multi extensionKind support

VS Code now supports running extensions defined with multiple extension kinds.

The following table shows given the extension with extensionKind(s), where VS Code enables/installs the extension.

| Extension Kind \ Location   | Local (Only) | Remote (Only)     | Both |
| :---        |    :----:   |          :----:   | :---   |
|    ["ui"]  |  ✅        | ❌    | ✅ (Local) |
| ["workspace"]   | ❌        | ✅     | ✅ (Remote) |
| ["ui", "workspace"]   | ✅       | ✅     | ✅ (Local) |
| ["workspace", "ui"]   | ✅       | ✅     | ✅ (Remote) |
