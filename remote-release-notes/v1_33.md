# March 2019 (version 1.33)

## VS Code Remote Core

### Remote Window Indicator Menu

The Remote Window Indicator is now clickable and shows a menu with commands that are useful in the remote context.
To contribute a command to the menu use the menu contribution point

```json
menus": {
      "statusBar/windowIndicator": [
        {
          "command": "wsl.newWindow",
          "when": "remote.wslContext"
        },
        {
          "command": "wsl.showLog",
          "when": "remote.wslContext"
        }
      ]
```

Note the `"statusBar/windowIndicator"`menu point is proposed API and usage is restricted. See [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/using-proposed-api) for details.

### More control over Recent Menu Label

There's a new option on the `vscode.openFolder` to define that the opened window should not appear in the recent menu.

```typescript
interface IOpenFolderAPICommandOptions {
	forceNewWindow?: boolean;
	noRecentEntry?: boolean;
}
```

Alternatively recent menu entries can be removed by the command `_workbench.removeFromRecentlyOpened`.

The labels of the `File > Recent` menu are by default rendered by the contributed `resourceLabelFormatters`. Custom labels are possible by using the new (internal) command `_workbench.addToRecentlyOpened`.

### `--wait` in the remote CLI

The remote CLI now supports `--wait` on files.

Open a remote terminal and open a file with `code-wsl fileName --wait`. The command blocks until the user closes the editor.

### `--status` in the remote CLI

Use`--status` also in the remote CLI to gather information for local and remote VSCode processes.

### Remote User Settings

There are some extensions that allow users to customize some executable paths and they require these paths to exist on the machine they are running in. You can now configure such settings defined by extensions running in remote machine using **Remote User Settings**. You can open the `settings.json` file located in `<user-home>/.vscode-server/data/User/settings.json` folder in the remote machine using the command **Preferences: Open User Settings (Host Name)** and customize the settings you want.

![Remote User Settings](images/1_33/remote-user-settings.png)

You can customize all settings in remote user settings just like in normal user settings. These will override the local user settings and the hierarchy is as follows:

* User (Local) -> User (Remote) -> Workspace -> Workspace Folder

Remote settings are abstracted from extensions and they receive the value that is a merge of local and remote value as a `global` value when they inspect the configuration using `WorkspaceConfiguration.inspect` method. While writing the configuration into global target, VS Code smartly updates the user value based on its existence. It writes into remote user settings file if it exists there otherwise writes into local user settings file.

### Experimental terminal latency mitigation

Because the input for the terminal is on the client side and the process is on the server side that means there is an inherent delay on high latency connections. A new experimental latency mitigation feature has been added to try to help with this by intelligently printing the character to the terminal immediately if it has a high likelihood of being correct. The primary case we're trying to cover currently is entering in commands.

Currently this works only for alpha-numeric characters and will bail out and await the cursor's row to change as soon as something unexpected happens. There are some ideas to make this much smarter to be able to handle zero latency full line editing (left/right, ctrl+left/right, home/end, backspace, etc.) and make it more resilient when things go wrong.

This is enabled by default but you can opt out by setting `terminal.integrated.enableLatencyMitigation` to `false`.

### Terminal link support

The terminal now supports links, regardless the backend OS that the shell is running on.

This also laid the groundwork for getting links working in Live Share, or any terminal using a [TerminalRenderer](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/70978#issue-424352412).

### Terminal reflow working on Windows

Reflow in the terminal is disabled on Windows by design, this release enables reflow on Windows clients connected to Linux/macOS remotes.

### Testing with the Test Resolver

When running ouf of sources you can now open a remote Window without the need for WSL, Docker or a VM. A `Test Resolver` has been added that runs the remote agent on the same machine and file system as the UI.

To use the Test Resolver:

* Open `./scripts/code.sh(bat)`
* Invoke `Remote Test: New Window` from the Command Palette

or

* Run `./scripts/code.sh --folder-uri vscode-remote://test+test/home/aeschli/testProject` from the command line.

### Integration tests and smoke tests with the Test Resolver

You can now run the integration tests and smoke tests using the test resolver like so:

```bash
./scripts/test-remote-integration.sh # .bat

# Smoke tests
yarn smoketest --remote
```

Note that `test-remote-integration.sh(bat)` is called towards the end of the regular `test-integration.sh(bat)` scripts.

### Run integration test using any resolver

The `test-remote-integration.sh(bat)` script now accepts an `authority` and a `path` as the first and second arguments, allowing you to run the VS Code integration tests against any resolver.

For example:

```bash
./scripts/test-remote-integration.sh vscode-remote://ssh-remote+myvm /home/myuser
```

### Integration tests running in CI

Integration tests, including the test resolver tests, are now being run in CI for both macOS and Windows.

### Port-forwarding in WebView

The proposed port mapping api for webviews lets extensions control how localhost resources are resolved inside of webviews. Mapped ports are transparently resolved to the localhost where the extension that created the webview is running. If a remote extension spawns a server on port 3000 on remote machine for example, it can serve resources from this remote server to its webviews using port mappings.

All extensions that accesses resources on localhost should define port mappings to ensure that localhost resources are correctly resolved to the same host as the extension. This can be as simple as a no-op port mapping: `{ port: 3000, resolvedPort: 3000 }`

### Reconnection

Both VS Code clients and servers will now cache unacknowledged messages and begin a process of reconnection when the connection is lost.

On the client side, once a connection loss case is encountered, VS Code will invoke the resolver multiple times, until a connection is established, or after 30 unsuccessful connection attempts.

On the server side, processes and resources will be kept for 1hr. If the client does not reconnect after 1hr, then the resources will be freed.

Currently, there is no UI to indicate what is going on, the developer tools is the only place which logs a bit of what's going on.

## SSH

### Resolver tests

A set of resolver tests has been created to ensure the login flow is not broken in the future. These work by centralizing interactions with the system inside an interface and mocking out that interface in the tests, enforcing the order of calls and how they're called, allowing us to simulate various ssh configurations without setting up containers/VMs to test against.

### Tests running inside the an SSH-connected window

It's now possible to run both the SSH integration tests as well as the VS Code integration tests inside an SSH connected window.

```bash
# Run the SSH integration tests in an SSH-connected window
./extensions/open-ssh-remote/scripts/test-remote.sh SSH_HOST # or .bat

# Run the VS Code integration tests in an SSH-connected window
./extensions/open-ssh-remote/scripts/test-vscode-integration.sh SSH_HOST # or .bat
```

These are currently not run in CI but may be once we separate the repository.

### Use of Terminal for all SSH flows

To connect to a remote via SSH, we have to run a few commands to verify that the machine is the correct platform, to install the remote agent, and to forward the remote agent's port over SSH. All of these are now run in the terminal. We added the setting `remote.SSH.showLoginTerminal` - when this is enabled, the terminal will always be revealed when a command is run.

For some setups, setting `remote.SSH.showLoginTerminal` will be required.

Examples:

* Connecting with 2-factor authentication
* Using password auth
* Using an SSH key with a passphrase when the SSH agent is not running or accessible

### SSH Explorer improvements

The SSH explorer now shows guidance within otherwise empty sections. We also hide the port forwarding section in local windows and property handle the interaction between commands initiated from the Command Palette and the explorer.

![Guidance in empty sections](images/1_33/no-empty-sections.png)

We now have icons:

![Icons in the explorer](images/1_33/ssh-explorer-icons.png)

#### Experimental: Light-weight Azure Integration into the SSH Explorer

If you have installed the Azure Account extension and you are logged in, we try to determine the state of your VMs and allow you to start and stop them. This is particularly useful when you enable Auto-Shutdown on your VMs. **Note**: We are still missing proper icons to represent the VM states.

![Light-weight Azure integration](images/1_33/light-weight-azure-integration.gif)

In order to explore potential scalability issues, this is guarded by a setting:

```json
"remote.SSH.enableAzureIntegration": true
```

**Note**: In order for this to work correctly, the Azure Account extension needs to be installed as a UI extension which prevents remote extensions from having a dependency on the Azure Account extension. There is no solution in place yet.

```json
    "_workbench.uiExtensions": [
        "ms-vscode.azure-account"
    ]
```

### Default Extensions

Using the `remote.SSH.defaultExtensions` setting, you can now specify which extensions should be installed at the same time a VS Code Server is being installed.

```json
"remote.SSH.defaultExtensions": [
  "ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin",
  "eamodio.gitlens"
]
```

## WSL

### WSL in VM2 mode

Adoptions have been made to run the VSCode server in the new WSL VM2 mode.

## Docker

### Environment Variables in `devContainer.json`

Environment variables can be referred to as, e.g., `${env:HOME}` in the `devContainer.json`. They are replaced with the environment variable's current value when the `devContainer.json` is loaded.

### Exposed Ports in Log Output

The list of exposed ports is shown in the Dev Containers terminal after the container has started:

```bash
--------------------------------------------
Published Ports:
8080/tcp -> 127.0.0.1:8080
1234/tcp -> 127.0.0.1:1234

Extension Host Agent: http://localhost:54321
--------------------------------------------
```

### Improved Error Handling

If the startup fails, a modal error dialog is shown offering to open documentation on the web. After the error dialog, a picker with a list of possible actions to retry/escape the hang is shown.

## Web Companion

### Real Filesystem support

The web companion is now able to serve the file system from its container to the client. This is possible by connecting through a browser websocket connection to the remote and refactoring the file service to allow it to be run from the browser.

![WebIDE](images/1_33/web-ide.png)

**Note:** the file system is currently configured to be readonly.

### Bundled with Remote Server

The web companion is now bundled with the remote server, making it possible to open the contents of a container through the web easily with a workbench that runs in the web.

### Custom Dialog support

A custom dialog service has been added to enable modal dialogs in the web companion. These can be selfhosted with the hidden setting `workbench.dialogs.customEnabled` as `true`.

![Custom Dialogs](images/1_33/custom_dialogs.png)

### Exploration: Textmate in the browser

This milestone, we explored what it would take to get *vscode-textmate* running in the browser. In the end, we were successful in getting in loaded with some hacks. *vscode-textmate* will need some repacking to remove any node usage and our loader will need to support loading the packed files from *node_modules* without node.
