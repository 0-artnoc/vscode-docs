### Environment Variables Probe

The `devcontainer.json` has a new property `"userEnvProbe"` to specify if environment variables should be extracted from the container user's startup scripts. Supported values are `"none"` (the default), `"loginInteractiveShell"` (e.g., sourcing `.bash_profile` for Bash) and `"interactiveShell"` (e.g., sourcing `.bashrc` for Bash). Which scripts are run depends on the container user's default shell.
