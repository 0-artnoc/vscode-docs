# February 2020 (version 1.43)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Open remote workspaces via application links

VS Code can now open a remote workspace via protocol links.

The syntax is as follows:

```bash
vscode://vscode-remote/<remoteName>+<resolverArguments>/<path>
vscode-insiders://vscode-remote/<remoteName>+<resolverArguments>/<path>
```

### Recommendations for remote extensions

When opening a link to a remote workspace, but the corresponding remote extension is not yet installed, a recommendation makes it easy to do so:

## SSH

### Stabilized support for Windows hosts

We have had experimental support for Windows hosts in VS Code Insiders for a few months now, but we are now ready to say that this support is stable and can be used in the VS Code stable release!

### Support for macOS hosts

We now support connecting to macOS hosts. You don't need to do anything - when you connect to the host, VS Code will automatically detect which platform you are connecting to. And it is already supported in the stable version of VS Code.

### Connection-sharing mode enabled by default

[A few months ago](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/master/remote-release-notes/v1_39.md#ssh-connection-sharing), we added a new connection mode for Remote - SSH which creates a single SSH connection per host and can share that connection between windows and across window reloads. This reduces the time it takes to open a new window and the number of times you need to enter your password. It has been available behind a setting but this mode is now enabled by default.

## Containers

### New configuration properties

The `devContainer.json` file supports additional properties:

* `initializeCommand` can be used to run a command before building or rebuilding a container. The property can be set to a string that is run in a shell or to an array of strings which are run without a shell.

* `build` allows to define the docker [build target](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#specifying-target-build-stage---target) and [build arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg). It is now also possible to specify the `dockerFile` and `context` properties inside the `build` section (the old location is still supported).

Here is an example:

```json
{
    "build": {
        "dockerfile": "...",
        "context": "...",
        "target": "...",
        "args": {
            "FOO": "BAR"
        }
    }
}
```

### Dotfiles repository support - generalized setting value

In the last iteration we have added support for [dotfiles](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/vnext/remote-release-notes/v1_42.md#dotfiles-repository-support) and corresponding settings `remote.containers.dotfiles`. Since dotfiles are a generally useful mechanism that are not only used for VS Code Remote Container but also by [VS Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/online/reference/personalizing#visual-studio-online-personalization-reference) we now also support a more general setting name `dotfiles`, that will eventually allow to define the `dotfiles` preferences with a single setting.

## WSL

### Docker in WSL

The Windows team has been busy adding Docker support to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and you can learn how to work with Docker, VS Code, and WSL 2 from the [Using Docker in WSL 2](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2020/03/02/docker-in-wsl2) blog post.
