# February 2020 (version 1.43)

## Visual Studio Code Remote Core

### Open remote workspaces via application links

VS Code can now open a remote workspace via protocol links.

The syntax is as follows:

```bash
vscode://vscode-remote/<remoteName>+<resolverArguments>/<path>
vscode-insiders://vscode-remote/<remoteName>+<resolverArguments>/<path>
```

## SSH

### Stabilized support for Windows hosts

We have had experimental support for Windows hosts in VS Code Insiders for a few months now, but we are now ready to say that this support is stable and can be used in the VS Code stable release!

### Support for macOS hosts

We now support connecting to macOS hosts. You don't need to do anything - when you connect to the host, VS Code will automatically detect which platform you are connecting to. And it is already supported in the stable version of VS Code.

### Connection-sharing mode enabled by default

[A few months ago](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/master/remote-release-notes/v1_39.md#ssh-connection-sharing), we added a new connection mode for Remote-SSH which creates a single SSH connection per host and can share that connection between windows and across window reloads. This reduces the time it takes to open a new window and the number of times you need to enter your password. It has been available behind a setting but this mode is now enabled by default.
