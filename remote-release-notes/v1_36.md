# June 2019 (version 1.36)

## VS Code Remote Core

### Save As to local filesystem

The remote file picker now supports Save As locally. If you have a file on your remote that you want to save locally, you can use the “Show Local” button from “Save As” to save the file on your local filesystem.

### Close Remote Connection

A new command `Close Remote Connection` lets you close the remote connection and continue with an empty local window. The command is available in the Remote indicator menu and and also in the File menu.

### Explorer impovements

#### Drag and Drop

We now support more drag and drop scenarios for the explorer in the remote context:
* You can drag a single file from the remote VS Code explorer to your local machine. Due to an upstream limitation we can not support this on Linux or for multiple files
* You can drag any number of files and folders from your machine to the remote VS Code explorer

#### Download

We have introduced a Download context menu action which works with multiple selection so it is possible to download any number of files and folders to your local machine.

#### Better label for empty explorer

The empty explorer now has a more context aware label that shows the state of the remote connection.

### Local terminal support

A new command is registered in remote workspaces that lets you create a local terminal, these will be marked with "(Local)" in the terminal dropdown.

## Extensions

VS Code client downloads and installs the extensions into VS Code server when the server cannot. This will help installing extensions in VS Code server when the server has network connection issues like behind some newtork proxy setup.

## Containers

### Experimental Alpine Linux support

Support for Alpine Linux is available in VS Code Insiders (https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/). We are holding this back from the stable release to allow for extension authors to catch up with the additional platform, see [Supporting Remote Development](/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions.md) for details.

### Read default shell and home folder from `/etc/passwd`

The default shell and the home folder are now read from `/etc/passwd`.
You can still set the SHELL or HOME environment variables to override.

### Remote-Containers: Show Log

The `Remote-Containers: Show Log` command reveals the log of the Remote Container.

### Improved test coverage

The Remote Containers extension has been refactored to allow for unit testing and the test coverage has been improved.


## WSL

### Select Linux distro

Until now, the Remote WSL extension was limited to use the default distro as configured by `wslconfig.exe`.
Now you can open a Remote WSL window with any distro. The new `Remote WSL: New Window using Distro...` command lets you select from the list of installed distros. Alternativly you can start by opening a shell of the WSL distro and open the VS Code Remote Window with `code .`.

To install new distros, go to the Windows Store and search for `WSL`. You will find a selection of Linux distro, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSuse that can all be installed in paralell. Note: Alpine WSL is not yet supported by the Remote WSL extension.

The WSL Remote extension requires WSL from Windows 10, May 2019 Update (version 1903) for this feature to work.

### `Reopen Folder in WSL` and `Reopen Folder in Windows`

There are new command that let easy you switch from Window to WSL and back.
- When in a local folder or workspace, `Reopen Folder in WSL` reopens the input in WSL. If you have multiple distros installed, a picker will let you select the distro to use.
- In a WSL Remote window, `Reopen Folder in Windows` reopens the current folder or workspace in Windows.

### Server Download on Window side

The WSL extension now downloads the VSCode server build on the Windows side instead out of WSL. This fixes issues with missing proxy settings or certificates in WSL.

### Use polling for file watching in WSL

The file watcher now uses polling on the WSL side. This fixes the issue that renaming non-empty folders in open the workspace didn't work.
