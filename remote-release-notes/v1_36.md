## VS Code Remote Core

### Save As to local filesystem

The remote file picker now supports Save As locally. If you have a file on your remote that you want to save locally, you can use the “Show Local” button from “Save As” to save the file on your local filesystem.

### Explorer impovements

#### Drag and Drop

We now support more drag and drop scenarios for the explorer in the remote context:
* You can drag a single file from the remote VS Code explorer to your local machine. Due to an upstream limitation we can not support this on Linux or for multiple files
* You can drag any number of files and folders from your machine to the remote VS Code explorer

#### Download

We have introduced a Download context menu action which works with multiple selection so it is possible to download any number of files and folders to your local machine.

#### Better label for empty explorer

The empty explorer now has a more context aware label that shows the state of the remote connection.
