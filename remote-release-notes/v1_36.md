# June 2019 (version 1.36)

## VS Code Remote Core

### Save As to local filesystem

The remote file picker now supports Save As locally. If you have a file on your remote that you want to save locally, you can use the “Show Local” button from “Save As” to save the file on your local filesystem.

### Explorer impovements

#### Drag and Drop

We now support more drag and drop scenarios for the explorer in the remote context:
* You can drag a single file from the remote VS Code explorer to your local machine. Due to an upstream limitation we can not support this on Linux or for multiple files
* You can drag any number of files and folders from your machine to the remote VS Code explorer

#### Download

We have introduced a Download context menu action which works with multiple selection so it is possible to download any number of files and folders to your local machine.

#### Better label for empty explorer

The empty explorer now has a more context aware label that shows the state of the remote connection.

## Extensions

VS Code client downloads and installs the extensions into VS Code server when the server cannot. This will help installing extensions in VS Code server when the server has network connection issues like behind some newtork proxy setup.

## Containers

### Experimental Alpine Linux support

Support for Alpine Linux is available in VS Code Insiders (https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/). We are holding this back from the stable release to allow for extension authors to catch up with the additional platform, see [Supporting Remote Development](/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions.md) for details.

### Read default shell and home folder from `/etc/passwd`

The default shell and the home folder are now read from `/etc/passwd`.
You can still set the SHELL or HOME environment variables to override.

### Remote-Containers: Show Log

The `Remote-Containers: Show Log` command reveals the log of the Remote Container.

### Improved test coverage

The Remote Containers extension has been refactored to allow for unit testing and the test coverage has been improved.
