# May 2020 (version 1.46)

## VS Code Remote Core

With this release, we allow you to install an already installed mulit-kind (that can run locally or remotely) extension in its preferrable location using `Install in Remote` or `Install Locally` action. For example, take [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) that preferrably runs remotely and is installed and running locally, then we show `Install in Remote` action on Docker extension to install and run it remotely as below:

*Theme: GitHub Sharp with Customizations*

`Remote: Install Local Extensions in Remote` command that lists extensions to install on remote now also includes all multi-kind extensions.
