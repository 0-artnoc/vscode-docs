# May 2020 (version 1.46)

## VS Code Remote Core

With this release, we allow you to install an already installed mulit-kind (that can run locally or remotely) extension in its preferrable location using `Install in Remote` or `Install Locally` action. For example, take [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) that preferrably runs remotely and is installed and running locally, then we show `Install in Remote` action on Docker extension to install and run it remotely as below:

*Theme: GitHub Sharp with Customizations*

`Remote: Install Local Extensions in Remote` command that lists extensions to install on remote now also includes all multi-kind extensions.

## Containers (version xxx)

### Inspect a Docker Volume

You can now inspect the contents of a Docker volume using Visual Studio Code. The command `Remote: Inspect a Volume in a Container...` allows you to select a volume. The selected volume is mounted into a dev container which is then opened in Visual Studio Code. The command is also available in the Docker viewlet in the `Volumes` section.

### Improved iterative development of a devcontainer's Dockerfile for Repository Containers

When **Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...** fails to start the [Repository Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume), for example, due to an error when building the Docker image, you can now open the cloned repository in a recovery container. The error dialog shown now provides an action **Reopen in Recovery Container**. This action opens the cloned repository in a minmal container that comes with Git and Docker so that you correct the error. Once you have fixed the error you can reopen the container using **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**.
