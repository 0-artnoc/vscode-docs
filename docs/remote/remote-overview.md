# VS Code Remote Development

While many developers edit, build, deploy, and debug on their local machines, there are an increasing number of situations where you may need to interact with a codebase or runtime on the other side of an OS boundary.

For example, you may want to:

- Develop on the **same operating system** you deploy to or use **larger, faster, or more specialized** hardware than your local machine.
- **Sandbox** your development environment to avoid accidentally impacting to your local **machine configuration**.
- Make it easy for new contributors to **get started** and keep everyone in a **consistent environment**.
- Use tools or runtimes **not available** on your local OS or manage **multiple versions** of them.
- Develop your Linux-deployed applications using the **Windows Subsystem for Linux**.
- Access an **existing** development environment from **multiple machines or locations**.
- Debug an **application running somewhere else** such as a customer site or in the cloud.

**[Visual Studio Code Remote Development](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension)** addresses these needs by allowing your local VS Code installation to transparently interact with source code and runtime environments sitting on other machines (whether virtual or physical).

Remote development means that **no source code needs to be on your local machine**, a big improvement over using network shares or synchronizing files.

VS Code provides a **local-quality development experience** including full IntelliSense, debugging, and more **regardless of where your code is hosted**.

## Getting started

> **Dogfooding Notes (UPDATED):**
> 1. You currently need to install a private versions of the VS Code Remote Development extensions. First download [Visual Studio Code - Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).
> 2. Next, sign into a Microsoft GitHub org associated GitHub account from a browser.
> 3. Download and manually install the latest VSIX of the [Selfhost Remote Extensions Updater](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension) in VS Code â€“ Insiders.
> 4. The first time the Selfhost Remote Extensions starts, you may be prompted to paste in a GitHub access token so that it can download and auto-update private versions of the extensions. You only need to give "Repo" scope to this token.
> 5. Reload / restart VS Code - Insiders.

### Remote Development extension pack

The **[Remote Development extension pack](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension)** includes three extensions that unlock the power of VS Code in a variety of situations.

Click on the links below to learn more:

- **[SSH](/docs/remote/ssh.md)** - Connect to any location by opening folders on a remote machine/VM using SSH.
- **[Containers](/docs/remote/containers.md)** - Work with a sandboxed toolchain or container-based application inside (or mounted into) a container.
- **[WSL](/docs/remote/wsl.md)** - Get a Linux-powered development experience in the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

While most VS Code extensions should work unmodified in a remote environment, extension authors can learn more at [Supporting Remote Development](/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions.md).
