# Settings Sync

>**Note**: Settings Sync is still in Preview and must be manually enabled in VS Code Stable releases. It is on by default on VS Code [Insiders](/insiders).

## To enable Settings Sync

Turn on sync using **Sync: Turn On** entry in the gear menu at the bottom of the activity bar. You will be asked what preferences you would like to sync; currently Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, Extensions, and the Display Language are supported.

After making this selection, the browser will open so that you can login to a Microsoft account. Both personal accounts, such as Outlook accounts, and Azure accounts can be used. If you're signing in to Microsoft for the first time, there is also an option to sign in with GitHub. If at any time you decide you want to sync your data to a different account, you can use the `Microsoft: Sign Out` command from the command palette, and then use the `Sync: Sign in to sync` entry from the gear menu.
