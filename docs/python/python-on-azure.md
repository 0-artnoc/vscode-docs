# Deploy Python to Azure

The [Azure Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) extensions for Visual Studio Code make it easy to deploy Python applications (including containers) to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service) and to deploy serverless code to [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions).

The following tutorials on the [Python Azure Developer's Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/python) walk you though the details:

- [Deploy Python web apps to Azure App Service with VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/python/tutorial-deploy-app-service-on-linux-01)
- [Deploy Python containers to Azure App Service with VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/python/tutorial-deploy-containers-01)
- [Deploy Python to Azure Functions with VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/python/tutorial-vs-code-serverless-python-01)
